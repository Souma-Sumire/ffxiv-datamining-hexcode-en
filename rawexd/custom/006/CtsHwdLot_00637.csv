1,"TEXT_CTSHWDLOT_00637_LIZBETH_010_000","If you're interested in kupo nuts, I'm afraid I cannot assist. But if you're interested in the Kupo of Fortune, you've come to the right place, kupo!"
2,"TEXT_CTSHWDLOT_00637_LIZBETH_010_010","A-Ahem. Please disregard my outfit. I was in the midst of preparing a new initiative for our friends of the Firmament, but it appears I took too long, for Enie then conceived of...this."
3,"TEXT_CTSHWDLOT_00637_LIZBETH_010_020","If you are interested in kupo nuts, I'm afraid I cannot assist. But if you're interested in the Kupo of Fortune, you've come to the right place, kupo!"
4,"TEXT_CTSHWDLOT_00637_LIZBETH_010_030","If it please you, I shall explain how the game works."
5,"TEXT_CTSHWDLOT_00637_LIZBETH_010_040","Upon each Kupo of Fortune card, there are four hexagons, each depicting a treasure chest provided courtesy of our moogle friends."
6,"TEXT_CTSHWDLOT_00637_LIZBETH_010_050","Playing is simple: you scratch open a chest of your choice."
7,"TEXT_CTSHWDLOT_00637_LIZBETH_010_060","If the chest holds something from first to fourth prize, congratulations! The fabulous item shown on the prize list is yours!"
8,"TEXT_CTSHWDLOT_00637_LIZBETH_010_070","But be fairly warned: a ferocious beast lies in wait for hapless treasure hunters. Should you find a griffin instead, you must console yourself with a consolation prize."
9,"TEXT_CTSHWDLOT_00637_LIZBETH_010_080","Now, for some important details. The chest on the left holds only second, third, and fourth prizes. Meaning, while you cannot win first prize, neither is there the danger of finding a griffin."
10,"TEXT_CTSHWDLOT_00637_LIZBETH_010_090","The three chests on the right, meanwhile, can hold any of the four prizes as well as a griffin. Meaning, while you have a chance to reap the richest reward, you may also walk away with a paltry prize. Which side you scratch open is entirely your choice."
11,"TEXT_CTSHWDLOT_00637_LIZBETH_010_100","As the prizes on offer change each time you play, be sure to cast an eye over the prize list before trying your luck."
12,"TEXT_CTSHWDLOT_00637_LIZBETH_010_110","That concludes the explanation. If you wish to review the rules, I will post the information to the skybuilders' board, so please refer to it at your leisure."
13,"TEXT_CTSHWDLOT_00637_LIZBETH_010_120","Oh, and are you aware of our new venture for procuring materials? If not, I urge you to seek out Flotpassant for details."
14,"TEXT_CTSHWDLOT_00637_LIZBETH_010_130","Oh, and may I ask if you've been informed about exchanging skybuilders' scrips? If not, I urge you to seek out Enie for the details."
15,"TEXT_CTSHWDLOT_00637_LIZBETH_020_000","If you're interested in kupo nuts, I'm afraid I cannot assist. But if you're interested in the Kupo of Fortune, you've come to the right place, kupo! Will you be trying your luck today, my <hex:02080FE905FF05>lady<hex:FF05>lord<hex:03>?"
16,"TEXT_CTSHWDLOT_00637_LIZBETH_030_000","Oh dear, it appears you don't have a kupo voucher. I suggest you speak with Potkin to see what items you can donate to earn the stamps required."
17,"TEXT_CTSHWDLOT_00637_LIZBETH_040_000","Oh dear, it seems you have no room in your bag for a prize. But rest assured the Kupo of Fortune will still be here after you've sorted your possessions."
18,"TEXT_CTSHWDLOT_00637_MENU_TITLE","A kupo voucher is required (<hex:022003E80203> remaining). Do you wish to play?"
19,"TEXT_CTSHWDLOT_00637_LIZBETH_050_000","<hex:026003020303>Oho, you've won first prize! Congratulations, kupopo!"
