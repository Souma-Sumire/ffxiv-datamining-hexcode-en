4423,False,"Almost time to eat!"
4424,False,"W-We'll get you some medicine..."
4425,False,"It's gotta be cooked by now..."
4426,False,"Did you hear what happened to that girl!?"
4427,False,"That ought to keep the wind out."
4428,False,"Please...<hex:02100103>Whatever you can spare..."
4429,False,"Maybe I should join him..."
4430,False,"But the letter from the Crystarium said..."
4431,False,"I hope this crop turns out better than the last..."
4432,False,"Don't you wag your finger at me!"
4433,False,"I once knew twins who had hair just like yours!"
4434,False,"We'd best scout the area first."
4435,False,"You can cross that bridge when you come to it."
4436,False,"The forest calls to me..."
4437,False,"I am not lying! I saw it!"
4438,False,"Well, if the others don't get here soon, we'll have to eat their share!"
4439,False,"Give me a moment, would you? I'm sure it's crooked!"
4440,False,"That is what Uimet said, anyway."
4441,False,"It is probably true, in that case."
4442,False,"Is everything ready?"
4443,False,"Master Lanille has taken care of it."
4444,False,"Then I shall return to my post."
4445,False,"I'd better count them again, just to be sure."
4446,False,"Yes, yes! Adorable!"
4447,False,"There must be at least one shiny here!"
4448,False,"Not a bad price, all things considered."
4449,False,"I'll get us a good deal, don't you worry!"
4450,False,"Now, you stay right there!"
4451,False,"Hmm? Where did it go?"
4452,False,"I take my eyes off of it for one moment..."
4453,False,"Come back here!"
4454,False,"Not again!"
4455,False,"Not good, not good..."
4456,False,"There it is!"
4457,False,"You must not wander off like that, understood?"
4458,False,"That's a fair point..."
4459,False,"I have a feeling I've forgotten something."
4460,False,"Come now, you mustn't fret."
4461,False,"It never ceases to amaze.<hex:02100103>Every time I see it..."
4462,False,"What am I supposed to do now!?"
4463,False,"A tasty morsel of information, yes?"
4464,False,"Leave no stone unturned..."
4465,False,"To see a sin eater from so close... I will never forget it."
4466,False,"And we'll split the profits!"
4467,False,"Yes, it's all here, as agreed."
4468,False,"So, ready to get back to work?"
4469,False,"Not yet. Still coughing up grey phlegm."
4470,False,"Erm... You might wanna get that looked at..."
4471,False,"The Fuath are nothing but trouble!"
4472,False,"As my master always used to say..."
4473,False,"Yes, better than boiling them, methinks."
4474,False,"A fair trade, it would seem."
4475,False,"A bit on the small side, perhaps..."
4476,False,"Slowly but surely do the mushrooms grow."
4477,False,"The blue one... Or the other blue one... Hmm..."
4478,False,"I am sure my eyesight is getting worse."
4479,False,"Oh! This is a heavy one!"
4480,False,"Gather round, little ones."
4481,False,"And we'll call it “Delta Attack!”"
4482,False,"Let's try shapechanging!"
4483,False,"That sounds like fun!"
4484,False,"Watch this!"
4485,False,"Ooh! I can't wait to see this!"
4486,False,"Piff, paff, poff!"
4487,False,"Eek!"
4488,False,"Oink!"
4489,False,"Hee hee! How terribly amusing!"
4490,False,"Haha! A porxie!"
4491,False,"Oink! Oink!"
4492,False,"Now I just need to work out how to reverse it..."
4493,False,"Wait for me!"
4494,False,"Come back!"
4495,False,"Ummm..."
4496,False,"It's a beaver!"
4497,False,"Snook!"
4498,False,"You'll never catch me!"
4499,False,"Snook! Chit!"
4500,False,"I wonder who pushed up <hex:021A020203>these<hex:021A020103> daisies?"
4501,False,"If I eat the whole thing, I shall go “pop!”"
4502,False,"All this frolicking has worn me out..."
4503,False,"Haven't you had enough!?"
4504,False,"Come on, lazy bones! There's frolicking to be done!"
4505,False,"So soft... So fluffy..."
4506,False,"No one can fly higher than meee～♪"
4507,False,"Now you see me, now you don't!"
4508,False,"Found me again! I'll have to try harder!"
4509,False,"Very good! Let's see if you can find me again!"
4510,False,"Ooh! You won't be so lucky next time!"
4511,False,"You're fun! Bye for now!"
4512,False,"Come now, don't sulk! Here, I brought you a flower!"
4513,False,"You're like a walking cloud!"
4514,False,"And they'll never suspect a thing!"
4515,False,"Hurry up and grow!"
4516,False,"Please, anything you can spare!"
4517,False,"That's what you get for pushing your luck!"
4518,False,"Nana nana nana nana, fishing!"
4519,False,"A steal at half the price!"
4520,False,"My fortune is just a few scoops of dirt away!"
4521,False,"As soon as his back's turned, that soup is mine!"
4522,False,"Next time, I'll set the line a bit lower."
4523,False,"Why must there be so many rules?"
4524,False,"I hope I haven't forgotten anything."
4525,False,"Why are they eating pebbles?"
4526,False,"Oh no! It looks like I've burnt it!"
4527,False,"He's gonna eat his face off! I can't wait!"
4528,False,"Go for the ribs! Don't let that bastard breathe!"
4529,False,"One good gust of wind, and the whole thing'll come down."
4530,False,"Maybe it's time to flip them over?"
4531,False,"Take that, you bastard nail! And that!"
4532,False,"This burgling lark's harder than I thought!"
4533,False,"If I stay drunk, I'll never get hungover!"
4534,False,"Stick to the plan, and we can't fail!"
4535,False,"Why must this take so long?"
4536,False,"They're sure to be impressed by my posing!"
4537,False,"Maybe I should draw the curtain..."
4538,False,"Be a good boy and fetch me some wine, would you?"
4539,False,"Yes, milady."
4540,False,"I had hoped there would be something in the Buttress to entertain me..."
4541,False,"...but it seems I was mistaken."
4542,False,"Back to the Understory it is."
4543,False,"Your wine, milady."
4544,False,"Tsk! That bloody fickle cow!"
4545,False,"""Where? Up your arse and 'round the corner!“ Ha!"
4546,False,"I wish they'd make these eyeholes a bit bigger."
4547,False,"Time for a stroll..."
4548,False,"...to the parlor!"
4549,False,"And then the wretched pauper split his head open! Hilarious!"
4550,False,"It's my money, and I'll spend it how I please!"
4551,False,"But, of courshe─hic!─the eldersh musht never know of thish!"
4552,False,"Oh, don't you worry about that, my friend!"
4553,False,"Haha! How very unlike you, Oboro!"
4554,False,"Hic! Perhapsh I have partaken a bit more than─hic─ushual..."
4555,False,"I tire of this place. Come."
4556,False,"Yes, my lady."
4557,False,"How frightfully vulgar!"
4558,False,"I quite agree."
4559,False,"Silence! When I want your opinion, I will ask for it!"
4560,False,"Yes, my lady!"
4561,False,"What I would not give for some stimulating conversation..."
4562,False,"One day, I shall buy this plaza and decorate in the manner of my choosing."
4563,False,"Yes, my lady..."
4564,False,"Care for a drink, sir?"
4565,False,"Can you not see I am busy!?"
4566,False,"I can't even give this stuff away..."
4567,False,"Why will no one take a drink?"
4568,False,"Maybe you should be more assertive?"
4569,False,"All right, I'll try."
4570,False,"Are you sure we haven't got anything better?"
4571,False,"Marry me, and you shall have everything you could wish for!"
4572,False,"It's about time I changed the string."
4573,False,"Oh my! How did you get so dusty?"
4574,False,"All right, you've made your point!"
4575,False,"I'd stick to the path if I were you."
4576,False,"But I'm ready for the front line!"
4577,False,"This ought to last us a while."
4578,False,"I'll work off this beer belly eventually!"
4579,False,"There'll be no trouble, I swear!"
4580,False,"There's something down there, I know it!"
4581,False,"Whoever built this thing must've been in a hurry."
4582,False,"Nothing to report!"
4583,False,"You'd better do one more circuit, just to be sure."
4584,False,"Yes, yes... I know how to do my job, thanks."
4585,False,"Soon, my pretty, soon..."
4586,False,"I could put one in that smug prick's back from up here. He wouldn't even know what hit him..."
4587,False,"And we even managed to get the best room they have!"
4588,False,"We should get away like this more often."
4589,False,"What could you have been doing to end up in such a state?"
4590,False,"Yes, but I hear enormous swords are all the rage!"
4591,False,"I want to see those noses touch the ground!"
4592,False,"If we pull this off, we'll make a killing!"
4593,False,"I swear my eyesight's getting worse..."
4594,False,"If I see you sleeping on the job again, you'll be on latrine duty until I say you've had enough!"
4595,False,"I have a feeling I'm in the wrong place..."
4596,False,"These feathers would fetch a gil or two..."
4597,False,"<pant> <pant>"
4598,False,"This is madness..."
4599,False,"Wh-What do we do...?"
4600,False,"Aaah!"
4601,False,"Shall we?"
4602,False,"Lead the way."
4603,False,"And here we have the Rotunda."
4604,False,"Watering, watering, all day long! "
4605,False,"All finished!"
4606,False,"Good work."
4607,False,"Here's the next batch."
4608,False,"So, I should scatter these in the same place."
4609,False,"That's right!"
4610,False,"And what comes after that?"
4611,False,"Yes, four apples, seven lemons. How many times must you count them!?"
4612,False,"My achin' bones..."
4613,False,"If I stare at those crates long enough, maybe they will move themselves."
4614,False,"Marvelous! Splendid!"
4615,False,"I fear this disagrees with my aesthetic sensibilities..."
4616,False,"This one might do..."
4617,False,"So? Find anything?"
4618,False,"I did indeed!"
4619,False,"And the reward is not bad either!"
4620,False,"Such vibrant colors!"
4621,False,"Where could it have gone?"
4622,False,"I'm sure it wouldn't sprout legs and walk off by itself."
4623,False,"Perhaps it found its way over here?"
4624,False,"Or perhaps not."
4625,False,"Maybe it's lurking in here?"
4626,False,"I do not see that posing any difficulties."
4627,False,"“By the time you read this, I shall surely be...”"
4628,False,"Well, perhaps if you'd brushed your hair away from your eyes, you'd have seen it!"
4629,False,"I should take another look, just in case."
4630,False,"But that would mean that cucumbers are fruit..."
4631,False,"We're still waiting for those new ladders to be delivered, I'm afraid."
4632,False,"“...and ripped out his still-beating heart...”"
4633,False,"I can never find what I'm looking for."
4634,False,"Something about needles and haystacks springs to mind..."
4635,False,"Would it kill them to organize things a bit better?"
4636,False,"Who needs ladders when you have magic!"
4637,False,"So, where is it?"
4638,False,"Erm..."
4639,False,"I didn't ask for an “erm,” did I?"
4640,False,"It should be ready soon."
4641,False,"Any idea how soon?"
4642,False,"I'm afraid not."
4643,False,"Hopefully it won't explode this time..."
4644,False,"Sir, yes, sir!"
4645,False,"You call that a squat!?"
4646,False,"Is everything here yet?"
4647,False,"How goes it?"
4648,False,"Well, it could be worse!"
4649,False,"Don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it."
4650,False,"Understood!"
4651,False,"Maybe I should lighten the load..."
4652,False,"I concur."
4653,False,"Well, there goes my lunch..."
4654,False,"Take it or leave it!"
4655,False,"I wonder what the problem is..."
4656,False,"I'd best make a note of this."
4657,False,"Everything seems fine here."
4658,False,"Not great, but acceptable."
4659,False,"Are you sure you don't need any?"
4660,False,"For the last time, no!"
4661,False,"Oh... I see."
4662,False,"I'll try asking again."
4663,False,"He's persistent, I'll give him that."
4664,False,"Oh gods, I think I've torn my breeches!"
4665,False,"How remarkably informative..."
4666,False,"He held an axe in each hand, and another with his tail!"
4667,False,"We have every garment the discerning professional could possibly need!"
4668,False,"It will make a fine gift."
4669,False,"What could possibly go wrong?"
4670,False,"You certainly have an eye for quality!"
4671,False,"Stop whining!"
4672,False,"I'll show her! I can live on stolen bread!"
4673,False,"Think of the profits we'll make!"
4674,False,"So she told him to take a long walk off a short pier!"
4675,False,"I shall leave it to the chef's discretion."
4676,False,"It all seems in order."
4677,False,"Thank you for keeping an eye on it!"
4678,False,"Don't mention it!"
4679,False,"Hmm... No leaks, no strange noises..."
4680,False,"What say you? Are you in?"
4681,False,"It might be easier to shoot them down with my bow."
4682,False,"Yes, about my room..."
4683,False,"I wonder which is the biggest?"
4684,False,"Where did all of these crumbs come from?"
4685,False,"I'm telling you! It's true!"
4686,False,"I want to be the Exarch this time!"
4687,False,"Lali-ho!"
4688,False,"How go the repairs?"
4689,False,"It's practically like new!"
4690,False,""
4691,False,"Mmmmmm, tastes like samurai..."
4692,False,"I'll have a dozen."
4693,False,"Can't talk─gotta train!"
4694,False,"If you gaze too long into the forest, the forest also gazes into you... "
4695,False,"And for my next trick, a handstand!"
4696,False,"Finlesss one, eh?"
4697,False,"I have a quessstion..."
4698,False,"Are you just going to ssstand there all day!?"
4699,False,"But it is ssso dry!"
4700,False,"But when you consider the<hex:02100103>implications of this latest<hex:02100103>calamity, you must admit..."
4701,False,"Trust in the scholars.<hex:02100103>They will find a solution."
4702,False,"What a precocious<hex:02100103>little child!"
4703,False,"If you could perhaps<hex:02100103>explain the finer points<hex:02100103>of the creation process..."
4704,False,"Yes, yes. Quite right..."
4705,False,"Citizens must be held<hex:02100103>to a higher standard..."
4706,False,"They've convened an<hex:02100103>emergency assembly."
4707,False,"This concerns us all."
4708,False,"Agreed. We must hurry..."
4709,False,"There's an incredible<hex:02100103>concept I just know<hex:02100103>you'll adore..."
4710,False,"You... I know...<hex:02100103>No, never mind."
4711,False,"The subject's potential<hex:02100103>is far beyond our<hex:02100103>wildest expectations..."
4712,False,"Where to put this...?"
4713,False,"I'm all for people having fun, but can't they learn to pick up after themselves?"
4714,False,"It's a mess, all right. But it could have been worse."
4715,False,"Look what I found!"
4716,False,"We have to clean up this mess before Master Gegeruju sees it..."
4717,False,"Even pirates clean up better than this!"
4718,False,"At least all the squatting I'm doing is good for my thighs..."
4719,False,"My muscles shine even brighter on these sparkling sands!"
4720,False,"As if it weren't bad enough already, the debris keeps floating in..."
4721,False,"We need to clean up before the Rising! Or wait, has it already started?"
4722,False,"It's a hassle, all right, but we can't just leave this trash here..."
4723,False,"Is that the last of it?"
4724,False,"Where do empty bottles go again...?"
4725,False,"All that digging makes me sleepy!"
4726,False,"Mummy!"
4727,False,"Just try to relax a little!"
4728,False,"Sh-Shut up already!"
4729,False,"So, are you going to jump any time soon?"
4730,False,"Where do I go for the bomb dance?"
4731,False,"I think I need a rest..."
4732,False,"I don't even want to <hex:021A020203>think<hex:021A020103> about climbing that!"
4733,False,"Look at me! I'm a pirate! Yarr!"

4736,False,"Hah! Getting to the top is child's play!"
4737,False,"Phew! Almost there!"
4738,False,"I don't have the nerve to try myself, but I do enjoy watching!"
4739,False,"They really saved the best for last..."

4741,False,"What's most important is that you have fun!"
4742,False,"What are you waiting for!? Give it a try!"
4743,False,"Only way to get there is from above, it seems."
4744,False,"Look! It's a slide!"
4745,False,"You're going to climb up there? That looks so scary!"
4746,False,"I hear there's a nice place to rest there!"
4747,False,"Ooh, look at those muscular thighs!"
4748,False,"Muscle-heads? Love 'em!"

4755,False,"Urgh..."
4756,False,"Shall we dance?"
4757,False,"A-one, and a-two, and a-one, and a-two!"
4758,False,"There's nothing like dancing your worries away!"
4759,False,"They have the battered fish again this year!"
4760,False,"Ooh! Let's get some and eat it on the beach!"
4761,False,"The wind calls us. Run as fast as your legs carry you and soar into the air."
4762,False,"There's no festival fairer than the Moonfire Faire!"
4763,False,"I can't wait to write a story about this!"
4764,False,"You did it! Congratulations!"
4765,False,"You're really something else!"
4766,False,"Incredible! You're my hero!"

4823,False,"Let me finish this page, all right?"
4824,False,"Perhaps we can give her a little push, tee hee!"
4825,False,"A rainbow! It's so beautiful!"
4826,False,"I wish Mummy could see this too!"
4827,False,"Do you think we can walk on it?"
4828,False,"You suppose it's all right to have a bite...?"
4829,False,"I want this in the Crystarium!"
4830,False,"Ahhh! He's adorable!"
4831,False,"Amazing! It's all made from sweets!"
4832,False,"Oh, don't even think about it! You'll make Tyr Beq mad!"
4833,False,"Do you know what this place is missing? Leafmen!"
4834,False,"<rumble> <rumble>"
4835,False,"<rumble> <rumble>"
4836,False,"Finally, a palatable dish."
4837,False,"Oh my! This is delicious!"
4838,False,"This is absolutely divine."
4839,False,"What a lovely meal."
4840,False,"My compliments to the chef."
4841,False,"To Lord Tolthewil! Long may he reign!"
4842,False,"Be welcome, <hex:020814E905FF06>madam<hex:FF09>good sir<hex:03>."

4846,False,"It's all in the hips."
4847,False,"<gasp> Would he truly say such things?"
4848,False,"We should hold a contest."
4849,False,"You're quite light on your feet."
4850,False,"Hahaha."
4851,False,"Come, let us put on a show!"
4852,False,"That's the way.<hex:02100103>Now, follow my lead."
4853,False,"Watch your step."
4854,False,"Hehehe."
4855,False,"A lovely thought."
4856,False,"Keep smiling dear.<hex:02100103>We have to keep smiling..."
4857,False,"Would that I could dance so wonderfully. Alas..."
4858,False,"How am I doing, dear?"
4859,False,"I see you've been practicing."
4860,False,"Relax, darling, you're doing fine."
4861,False,"If this is a dream, I hope to never wake."
4862,False,"Aren't you glad we came?"
4863,False,"Hm? Who is that?"
4864,False,"A guest of His Majesty?"
4865,False,"Will His Majesty be joining us?"
4866,False,"I cannot dance another step. A moment, I prithee..."
4867,False,"If there is aught you require, pray do not hesitate to ask."
4868,False,"Go ahead, eat until you're fit to burst!"
4869,False,"Well, if you put your mind to it, you could turn into a big tree yourself!"
4870,False,"I wish I was as big as that tree!"
4871,False,"If we use those big mushrooms, we can reach the top!"
4872,False,"And there might even be hidden treasure!"
4873,False,"Last one there's a rotten egg!"
4874,False,"Trickle, trickle! Splishy splash!"
4875,False,"Those horrid Fuath can't spoil our fun here!"
4876,False,"Would you like me to give you a push?"
4877,False,"Oh... It's a bit steep, isn't it?"
4878,False,"You were as quick as lightning!"
4879,False,"Did you see how fast I went?"
4880,False,"Let's do that again!"
4881,False,"See you at the top!"
4882,False,"We should make a bridge!"
4883,False,"All the colors of the rainbow!"
4884,False,"Look at all this space! Think of the possibilities!"
4885,False,"Let's make a big tower for the children to climb!"
4886,False,"And then they can fly from the top! Tee hee!"
4887,False,"Waterfalls are nice and all, but something is missing..."
4888,False,"What about something slippy? Or something slidey?"
4889,False,"We should host a tea party!"
4890,False,"With lots of delicious cakes!"
4891,False,"Or even better, a whole house made of sweets!"
4892,False,"They obey my every command..."
4893,False,"Would that my last partner could dance so well."
4894,False,"<hex:022C0DFF07><hex:022903EB0203><hex:FF02> <hex:0203>, so good of you to visit!"
4895,False,"Please have lots of fun!"
4896,False,"The children just love to lie in these and swing away."
4897,False,"Swinging on the wind, side and side again."
4898,False,"To their hearts' content!"
4899,False,"Fa la la la la.♪"
4900,False,"Enterprise...engage!"
4901,False,"Hm? What's an enterprise?"
4902,False,"I've no idea. I just heard someone say it."
4903,False,"Oh? I guess I'll say it too, then."
4904,False,"Enterprise...engage!"
4905,False,"Heh, that was strangely fun!"
4906,False,"I know, right!?"
4907,False,"I like flowers. They look pretty and smell nice."
4908,False,"Don't they, though?"
4909,False,"Do you know what this creature is?"
4910,False,"No. Wasn't there something like it in Lydha Lran?"
4911,False,"Right. It's called a moogle."
4912,False,"Moogle... And what's that peculiar thing attached to its head?"
4913,False,"That's a pom-pom, and they say that real ones glow!"
4914,False,"They glow? Really?"
4915,False,"I want one!"
4916,False,"Does it come off the moogle, do you think?"
4917,False,"If you pull hard enough, sure!"
4918,False,"Great! Let's collect lots and decorate with them!"
4919,False,"Phew. I'm glad for that to be over and done with."
4920,False,"We'd best leave the negotiations to Alphinaud and the Exarch."
4921,False,"Perhaps now we have afforded ourselves an audience."
4922,False,"Now they have little choice but to hear our plea."
4923,False,"So, what kind of dream should we spin next?"
4924,False,"I'm not sure. What do you think?"
4925,False,"Hmmm..."
4926,False,"How about...a great big sheep?"
4927,False,"With all the milk it gives us, we could make a milk fountain!"
4928,False,"Imagine it─we could drink and play at the same time!"
4929,False,"Oh, that sounds wonderful!"
4930,False,"Let's make lots of big sheep and drown all of Lyhe Mheg in milk!"
4931,False,"Uh... We're going to need to have a little talk..."
4932,False,"How about...a great big beast?"
4933,False,"Something that's a natural predator to the you-know-whats!"
4934,False,"Speaking of which...did you make cookies in their likeness?"
4935,False,"I did. Should I not have?"
4936,False,"I've been seeing them a lot outside, so I thought I'd try my hand..."
4937,False,""
4938,False,""
4939,False,"I must be careful."
4940,False,"Perhaps it'd be best to approach from the rear."
4941,False,"Oh! Its back is turned!"
4942,False,"I pray this works..."
4943,False,"Curses. It's not alone."
4944,False,"Calm yourself, old boy. Everything will be fine."
4945,False,"An opening!"

4948,False,""

4952,False,"Oh, what I wouldn't give to sing on this stage!"
4953,False,"I can just feel inspiration about to strike..."
4954,False,"Who has time for ardor and affection? We have a job to do..."
4955,False,"This is an unusual color to see at this time of year..."
4956,False,"Cheer up, won't you? Things will go better next time. I'm sure of it!"
4957,False,"Come, now. Let's give it another try!"
4958,False,"Gah! It's seen me!"
4959,False,"B-B-Bombs!"

4972,False,"Could use some shelves..."
4973,False,"Bet I can throw this further than you!"
4974,False,"Bet you can't!"
4975,False,"It's a grown-up! Run!"
4976,False,"W-We weren't being naughty or anything!"
4977,False,"Ugh, my back..."
4978,False,"Yes, Chief!"
4979,False,"Is there anything I can do?"
4980,False,"Hm... Where do we need hands right now?"
4981,False,"Let's see..."
4982,False,"Well and good to work hard, but you've got to rest as well."
4983,False,"B-B-Bloody hells it's cold!"
4984,False,"Huh? Where did I put that nail?"
4985,False,"Do you have enough hands?"
4986,False,"Aye, we're good here."
4987,False,"We could use help with some procurement."
4988,False,"I don't know much about braziers, but I know what I like."
4989,False,"I'll be careful, Chief!"
4990,False,"A fine feeling watching the place transform."
4991,False,"There's still a long way to go, but we'll get there."
4992,False,"Whoa!"
4993,False,"This is amazing!"
4994,False,"These special ingredients will keep our workers going all day long!"
4995,False,"Wh-What did I just eat?"
4996,False,"That's a mild way to put it."
4997,False,"Hmmm, toasty..."
4998,False,"Yes, rest up and be ready for more!"
4999,False,"Yeah!"
5000,False,"Get back here, you!"
5001,False,"I can't bear all this waiting around..."
5002,False,"Plain sailing ahead!"
5003,False,"I'd never shirk my duties as helmsman, but sometimes I do miss the days when it was just me and my rod."
5004,False,"Lucky for you I'm a fisher myself, so I know that slow and steady brings the bites. "
5005,False,"Never fails to take your breath away, does it?"
5006,False,"I'd best write today's log before I forget..."
5007,False,"It's hard to keep a steady hand when the ocean's beauty is distracting me."
5008,False,"I must record every detail of the day's weather conditions. Tedious work, but it must be done. "
5009,False,"Get your rods ready─here comes enough fish for the lot of you!"
5010,False,"And we're here! Time to fish!"
5011,False,"Looks like handsome hauls all around!"
5012,False,"Oi, can you hear me? Hey! Ahoy there! "
5013,False,"There's no mistaking this light─we've found ourselves a spectral current!"
5014,False,"Ain't got no need for small fry, so I throw 'em right back to the sea."
5015,False,"Ye ain't gotta see a fish to know its size! Mark well how long it takes to bite, and how fiercely it pulls."
5016,False,"An expert angler's got two qualities: patience and a discernin' eye. Don't waste time pullin' minnows outta the sea."
5017,False,"One cast, one catch!"
5018,False,"To catch a fish that's bein' conservative with its bites, you'll need to use your precision hookset."
5019,False,"If a fish is pullin' with the strength of an aurochs, you'll need a powerful hookset to match it."
5020,False,"If ye wanna get straight to fishin', spread some chum in the water and watch the fish crowd around!"
5021,False,"Now do some fishin' of yer own!"
5022,False,"Not every kind of bait will have fish chomping at your hook right away. However, patience is a virtue every fisher's got."
5023,False,"Rumor has it the bait they sell on the boat's what you want to use if it's the size of the catch you care about."
5024,False,"The ocean's full of hungry beasts all waiting for food to drop in front of their gullets─I've even seen shellfish at the end of some hooks!"
5025,False,"Now take your fill of the ocean's bounty!"
5026,False,"Look at this! We're above the clouds!"
5027,False,"Wow! The sea of clouds puts the real sea to shame!"

5040,False,"'Tis a boon we find this sanctum intact."
5041,False,"We may at last turn our attention to investigation."
5042,False,"My name shall be inscribed in the pages of history!"
5043,False,"Not if you stand around talking all day, it won't."
5044,False,"Ox'Dalan, grant me thy strength. And wisdom. And perhaps some extra luck wouldn't go amiss..."
5045,False,"Surely, you have chiseled enough?"
5046,False,"It's my turn!"
5047,False,"No! I must continue chiseling!"
5048,False,"Tradition dictates it!"

5054,False,"And scree to you, my good sir! ...Or was it madam?"
5055,False,"It says this is the way! ...I think."
5056,False,"<huff> <puff> Wait up, I say!"
5057,False,"A warding talisman? How splendid!"
5058,False,"Let the delving continue!"
5059,False,"We are much obliged to the Night's Blessed."
5060,False,"The tunnels are full of shiny, sparkly ore!"
5061,False,"We must better study how to care for the sick..."
5062,False,"Ronkan moss is very valuable. We must conserve our supply."
5063,False,"Do you think the serpent will like this?"
5064,False,"I must prepare a herbal soak!"
5065,False,"The serpent will surely be pleased!"
5066,False,"And one! And two!"
5067,False,"<whimper>"
5068,False,"<huff> <huff> I can run...no more..."

5077,False,"Scree..."
5078,False,"Scree!"
5079,False,"Scree! Scree!"
5080,False,"S-Screeeeeeeee!"
5081,False,"That cargo ain't gone through inspections yet. We got rules and regulations here─yer gonna have to put it back."
5082,False,"Where do ye want this?"
5083,False,"Ye must be jokin'..."
5084,False,"Urgh... The pain... I can't move an ilm or I'll..."
5085,False,"Just...just leave the medicine here...and go..."
5086,False,"Someone doesn't have their sea legs yet."
5087,False,"Don't give him any ideas..."
5088,False,"Sailed every corner of the high seas, huh?"
5089,False,"Goes down almost as easy as it comes up!"
5090,False,"Here, take a draught of this and you'll be set straight quick."
5091,False,"I don't mind the taste..."
5092,False,"Fish, of course. Oh, and here's some jewelry..."
5093,False,"Someone said a big boat was coming. Do you see it?"

5201,False,"Ah, blessed warmth..."
5202,False,"Such a grand house... It's wasted on me alone."
5203,False,"You're going to fall!"

5220,False,"Thank you, sir!"
5221,False,"Others will take care of the streets. We're looking ahead to the next stage!"

5228,False,"It's amazing how quickly the Firmament is coming along!"
5229,False,"Aye! I can't wait to live here!"
5230,False,"Such magnificent images of the Fury!"
5231,False,"Stack it there! Take care you don't get your fingers caught!"
5232,False,"Are all the blocks in good condition?"
5233,False,"Yes, miss! They're as solid as stone!"
5234,False,"Aye, sir!"
5235,False,"Byregot guide my hand!"
5236,False,"Are you all right up there!?"
5237,False,"You've brought it all up?"
5238,False,"Are you all right!?"
5239,False,"The nail that sticks out gets─<hex:02100103>OWWW!"
5240,False,"Y-Yes, sir... Everything's spinning a little, is all..."
5241,False,"Aye, sir!"
5242,False,"That should suffice for the sketch."
5243,False,"You've been studying the drafts, I see."
5244,False,"It's starting to take shape! Good!"
5245,False,"Is that a crack...?"
5246,False,"Each at least a dozen times like you said, sir!"
5247,False,"You're too kind, sir!"
5248,False,"Bring in materials for the other builders too!"
5249,False,"Are you all right!?"
5250,False,"I wonder what the kitchen's serv─<hex:02100103>OWWW!"
5251,False,"Coming along nicely."
5252,False,"That's a lot of supplies."
5253,False,"This is fine material. Handle it with care!"
5254,False,"Mmmmmm, smooth..."
5255,False,"Yes, sir! We're fortunate to have so many people donating!"
5256,False,"Yes, sir! Of course, sir!"
5257,False,"Large plot, prime location... Yes, this is absolutely perfect for me."
5258,False,"Bah!"
5259,False,"The houses are coming along nicely."
5260,False,"Begging your pardons, but these houses are for war-displaced Ishgardian citizens."
5261,False,"Wait! Who are you? What business have you here?"
5262,False,"The end is in sight! Let's stay focused!"
5263,False,"Honestly! Pay attention, will you!?"
5264,False,"Damn, what's the word for when you─<hex:02100103>OWWW!"
5265,False,"Yes, Chief!"
5266,False,"A masterpiece, even if I do say so myself."
5267,False,"You've improved in leaps and bounds, all of you!"
5268,False,"Yes, you may be proud of yourselves!"
5269,False,"<sniff> It's hard to believe we built something so beautiful."
5270,False,"We couldn't have done it without our friends from afar!"
5271,False,"There's strength in numbers...and in huge muscles!"
5272,False,"This building shall provide affordable housing for many families."
5273,False,"Thank you!"
5274,False,"Thank you... (I'll never live this down...)"
5275,False,"That was a close call. Be careful next time, both of you."
5276,False,"Behold the beauteous bladework of a Temple Knight!"
5277,False,"Feel the irrepressible power of the darkside!"
5278,False,"These houses are intended for war-displaced citizens such as your good selves."
5279,False,"Truly? We can live here?"
5280,False,"You'll be happy here, I promise."
5281,False,"When she said that she wanted a pet, I thought she had something a little smaller in mind..."

5287,False,"Let's review our lessons while we wait!"
5288,False,"Today, we shall learn more about the stars and their guidance."
5289,False,"I've brought meals for the workers."
5290,False,"Thank you! I'll see them handed out at once!"
5291,False,"Wait, you too?"
5292,False,"Me? I have an order for Marcelloix."
5293,False,"<click> <click> Let us see what work there is..."

5295,False,"Thank you kindly!"
5296,False,"Uwaaah! Not me this time!? Help! Somebody help!"
5297,False,"H-Hold on!"
5298,False,"You saved me before! Now it's my turn to save you!"
5299,False,"Th-Thank heavens..."
5300,False,"Ah, fiddlesticks! I slipped!"
5301,False,"Oh, you've got to be kidding me..."
5302,False,"Let us take a look. Heh heh heh..."
5303,False,"Can you tell me my skyward scores?"
5304,False,"What's that man doing?"
5305,False,"Looks like he's painting a picture."
5306,False,"Ughhh! I stubbed my bloody toe!"
5307,False,"Hello again,<hex:02100103>old friend..."
5308,False,"...So you visit him still. He would be glad."
5309,False,"Ooh ooh... <whimper>"
5310,False,"I see... You miss your fellows..."
5311,False,"Yes, sir! That's very considerate of you, sir!"
5312,False,"It's far nicer than I'd dared imagine!"
5313,False,"All's well with you and yours?"
5314,False,"To be able to live in a warm home... It's a dream come true!"
5315,False,"There, there. Sleep now, sweetling."
5316,False,"Right away, sir!"
5317,False,"<slurp> That smells amazing! Can I have a bowl?"
5318,False,"My ears are freezing! But that was so much fun!"
5319,False,"<huff> <huff> Yeah, we've got to do it again!"
5320,False,"Many thanks to those who came to our aid."
5321,False,"Just a little further to go..."
5322,False,"Dare I say we've seen the last of them?"
5323,False,"They were all bathed in Light... Why?"
5324,False,"There can be no doubt─'tis indeed the Exarch's magick."
5325,False,"That proved quite a detour, but all's well that ends well."
5326,False,"Play with us, Urianger! Just a little longer!"
5327,False,"Why tidy up now when you can do it never?"
5328,False,"Have at you!"
5329,False,"Yaaah!"
5330,False,"Here comes a big one!"
5331,False,"Stay sharp!"

5342,False,"How long do you think this'll last?"
5343,False,"Who knows? I'll just take it one day at a time."
5344,False,"No matter what happens to this town, we'll always have the view."
5345,False,"You're not getting out of this!"
5346,False,"What a mess!"
5347,False,"What are we supposed to do now!?"
5348,False,"Punishment! Punishment!"
5349,False,"You'd better talk fast!"
5350,False,"Good work! You've earned an extra lump of coal!"
5351,False,"<beep> Scrap collection complete."
5352,False,"<beep> Material salvage complete."
5353,False,"Complete? Not yet, it ain't! Go and get some more!"
5354,False,"First one to pass out loses!"

5360,False,"<beep> Commencing booze acquisition."
5361,False,"<beep> Awaiting instructions."
5362,False,"<beep> Booze acquired."
5363,False,"What I wouldn't give for a swig of grog!"
5364,False,"The key to Ronitt's success must be his poses. I'll start with those..."
5365,False,"What do you think? Just like Ronitt, eh?"
5366,False,"This either makes us look tough, or like we're squatting for another reason entirely."
5367,False,"We're not shirking! This is serious work, I'd have you know!"
5368,False,"Yeah! We're the Croaking Bullfrogs, and we wanna be just like Ronitt!"
5369,False,"No one messes with Ronitt! That's why he's our role model!"
5370,False,"Let me hear you shout!"
5371,False,"There you are!"
5372,False,"The perfect hiding place..."
5373,False,"Where might the others be?"
5374,False,"How did you know?"
5375,False,"Hee hee! Let's have some fun!"
5376,False,"We've been waiting for you!"
5377,False,"2P..."

5380,False,"Ugh, they're strong!"
5381,False,"●バトル前２B"
5382,False,"There should be no further danger here."
5383,False,"Oi! Where'd you put the thingamabob?"
5384,False,"Which thingamabob is that?"
5385,False,"The thingamabob with the whatsnames sticking out of it!"
5386,False,"Why didn't you say so? It's over there, I think."
5387,False,"The one place I hadn't looked!"
5388,False,"Wheels and gears! Gears and wheels!"
5389,False,"This way? Or this way?"
5390,False,"A tank! More metal for us!"
5391,False,"Where to start? Let's see now..."
5392,False,"This stone should still serve well..."
5393,False,"How do I even begin to repair this?"
5394,False,"Take care around the scaffold!"
5395,False,"Don't look down... Don't look down..."
5396,False,"The new building materials <hex:021A020203>still<hex:021A020103> haven't arrived?"
5397,False,"Any moment now, I reckon..."
5398,False,"Raaagh!"
5399,False,"Gwoooh!"
5400,False,"Nobody tosses a dwarf!"
5401,False,"Lali, lali, lali-hoooooo!"
5402,False,"Did you know Ronitt is the youngest?"
5403,False,"How about Karutt and Regitt?"
5404,False,"Regitt is three years older than Karutt."
5405,False,"Ozogg is one year younger than Karutt."
5406,False,"Ozogg is five years older than Ronitt. So how many apples does Regitt have?"
5407,False,"Please let me work here! I'll do anything!"
5408,False,"<hex:021A020203>Anything<hex:021A020103>, you say...?"
5409,False,"I want to serve Ishgard in any way I can!"
5410,False,"...Very well. But be warned─it's not easy work."
5411,False,"Ah, nothing beats the beach!"
5412,False,"All shark and no bite, hah!"
5413,False,"Ah, save me! Hold me!"
5414,False,"I've been waiting for this day all year!"
5415,False,"She's the belle of the beach!"
5416,False,"This summer will be even better than the last!"
5417,False,"It seems awfully complicated..."
5418,False,"The beach is the battlefield today, eh?"
5419,False,"Oh, what I wouldn't give to be a dancer too..."
5420,False,"If things're lookin' grim, I'll jump to your rescue!"
5421,False,"Now where's this so-called monster? I'm sure it's not so tough."
5422,False,"Legs!? It has legs!?"
5423,False,"Oh, I just want to snuggle it!"
5424,False,"Dance truly is a salve for the soul."
5425,False,"This dance will keep me and mine safe!"
5426,False,"The more the merrier!"
5427,False,"Not a pixie in sight. Thought they'd play a trick on us by now."
5428,False,"Aye. Wonder where they've all gotten to..."
5429,False,"Aye. All I see is that peculiar creature there..."
5430,False,"Can't put my finger on it, but something doesn't feel right..."
5431,False,"Let's report back for the time being."
5432,False,"We've brought what you asked."
5433,False,"Ooh, let me see! Let me see!"
5434,False,"Yes, not a one more or less than requested! Many thanks!"
5435,False,"Great. We'll be on our way, then."
5436,False,"Whew, I'm glad that went well."
5437,False,"Aye, get the amount wrong and they'll fair bite your head off..."
5438,False,"Well, that was a waste of a trip."
5439,False,"Bah, when they told us we could trade the stones here..."
5440,False,"They could've mentioned they don't deal in trifling quantities."
5441,False,"That'll teach us to do our due diligence and check."
5442,False,"Nothing for it but to go and gather some more."
5443,False,"Huzzah, the exit! Safe at last!"
5444,False,"My thanks for your kind aid!"
5445,False,"Don't mention it. Just glad to be of help."
5446,False,"No, no, I must thank you properly. Come with me to Mord Souq!"
5447,False,"We shall have a feast! Yes, a feast with our finest delacies!"
5448,False,"Oho, we won't say no to that! Right, Theyler?"
5449,False,"Hm, must say I'm curious about the local cuisine..."
5450,False,""
5451,False,"People made this!? With those fleshy stumps?"
5452,False,"They may be fleshy, but they are nimble, and ambitious besides."
5453,False,"The Sea of Clouds! Have you ever been?"
5454,False,"What is your home called?"
5455,False,"Wait... Where am I?"
5456,False,"I've come to give my regards to Ehll Tou, but I seem to have lost my way..."
5457,False,"Many thanks! It's so easy to lose your way here."
5458,False,"Maybe I can help. Who are you looking for?"
5459,False,"Ah, I know her! Everyone around here does. Climb these stairs and you should spot her before long."
5460,False,"There shouldn't be any sharks on these shores, especially not so close..."
5461,False,"The next big win is mine, I can feel it!"
5462,False,"My “Dawn Deck” will be unstoppable!"
5463,False,"Prepare to feel my fist of rage!"
5464,False,"Oh, calm down, Ulala..."
5465,False,"You've the worst mahjong face, my friend..."
5466,False,"Hmm, what should I do now...?"
5467,False,"<gasp> The size of this place!"
5468,False,"Where shall we start!?"
5469,False,"Just one more try..."
5470,False,"What, again!?"
5471,False,"There's a time for soldierin' and there's a time for loafin'."
5472,False,"Take care not to spend too much time in the sun."
5473,False,"We simply must introduce this dance in Coerthas, if only to bring a mote of summer's warmth with us."
5474,False,"So this is what an eternal summer feels like..."
5475,False,"I've never felt more alive!"
5476,False,"Good luck getting me to leave!"
5477,False,"It's so hot... Perhaps if I doffed my armor..."
5478,False,"Come on, get in the water!"
5479,False,"I don't ever want this celebration to end..."
5480,False,"Do you hear me!? I don't want to see a one of you slacking!"
5481,False,"My arm feels like it's about to fall off..."
5482,False,"Let's do this!"
5483,False,"Leave it to me."
5484,False,"I'll do the heavy lifting!"
5485,False,"Take that! And that!"
5486,False,"Steady the hips...and swing!"
5487,False,"Yes, this is quite an inspiring scene."
5488,False,"Just look at those bulging biceps..."
5489,False,"Keep at that same spot!"
5490,False,"Not half bad, I say."
5491,False,"My sides are achin' somethin' fierce..."
5492,False,"How's it lookin'?"
5493,False,"You got it, Chief!"
5494,False,"Ungh!"
5495,False,"Finally figured out how to use that pickaxe, I see."
5496,False,"How about you try your hand with a hammer next?"
5497,False,"Aye aye, Chief!"
5498,False,"Thank ye kindly!"
5499,False,"Pound! Smash! Crash!"
5500,False,"Hyah!"
5501,False,"Let me show you how it's done."
5502,False,"You lift the hammer like this, then...yah!"
5503,False,"Aha...so the secret's to take a running start!"
5504,False,"Phew! I need a rest..."
5505,False,"We should check on the others' progress."
5506,False,"Sounds like a plan!"
5507,False,"Is that blood? Am I bleeding!? Oh, the pain!"
5508,False,"Do you require more supplies?"
5509,False,"Progress report! And be quick about it!"
5510,False,"Are you sure that isn't upside down?"
5511,False,"Mustn't forget to take inventory..."
5512,False,"Hm? What curious foreign tongue is this?"
5513,False,"This should suffice for the time being, Chief."
5514,False,"That scaffold looks awfully wobbly..."
5515,False,"Right on schedule, Chief!"
5516,False,"Now, what do we need here...?"
5517,False,"I'll see that we're all stocked up!"
5518,False,"Those are for repairing the rooves. And these..."
5519,False,"This stone should serve us well."
5520,False,"Let's see. We still need to stock up on..."
5521,False,"Excellent. No delays here."
5522,False,"Now, what tasks remain undone?"
5523,False,"My stonemasonry skills will do Ishgard proud!"
5524,False,"This, too, would make for a stirring painting..."
5525,False,"I'll prepare a copy of the construction schedule for you."
5526,False,"Only the finest materials will do!"
5527,False,"Get a hold of yourself, damn it! It's a long way down!"
5528,False,"This should serve nicely for the floor."
5529,False,"This is so easy, I could do it with my eyes clo─<hex:02100103>OWWW!"
5530,False,"You must hone your eye for stone."
5531,False,"Don't forget to haul the materials in the proper order!"
5532,False,"The slightest chip or crack could send the walls crashing down."
5533,False,"Yes, this should suffice..."
5534,False,"Let me take another look..."
5535,False,"I'll do my best!"
5536,False,"Aye aye, Chief!"
5537,False,"We'll be needing extra hands for this."
5538,False,"Watch out for your hand!"
5539,False,"Maybe carpentry isn't for you..."
5540,False,"There's no need to rush, you know."
5541,False,"To build a strong foundation, every nail counts..."
5542,False,"I think I've finally got the hang of─<hex:02100103>OWWW!"
5543,False,"A little tap here, and a little tap there..."
5544,False,"If only I weren't so clumsy..."
5545,False,"How majestic!"
5546,False,"Such beautiful stone!"
5547,False,"Are you certain we have enough materials?"
5548,False,"Your thoroughness is admirable..."
5549,False,"I'm prone to mistakes─that's why I always check thrice!"
5550,False,"You'll find no better stone in all of Eorzea!"
5551,False,"Fifty-one, fifty-two, fifty─wait, did I count that one twice?"
5552,False,"If I just stack these here..."
5553,False,"This should do!"
5554,False,"Oho! Looking good, indeed!"
5555,False,"Steady now..."
5556,False,"Sigh... Why doesn't she ever notice me?"
5557,False,"Watch out for the thumb...watch out for the─<hex:02100103>OWWW!"
5558,False,"Heh! Lookin' good, eh?"
5559,False,"Fastest hammer in Ishgard, I tell you!"
5560,False,"Eat up! You'll need all the strength you can muster for the next shift!"
5561,False,"Saint Reymanaud's Cathedral wasn't built on an empty stomach, you know."
5562,False,"I'm going to feel this tomorrow..."
5563,False,"Time to work off that last flagon of ale!"
5564,False,"Unnngaaah!"
5565,False,"Nnngraaaaaah!"
5566,False,"It's all in the hips...hyaaah!"
5567,False,"Right! I'll tell the others."
5568,False,"...And that's what's on the agenda for tomorrow."
5569,False,"Hoooh! Haaah! Hoooh! Haaah!"
5570,False,"It just won't break. Am I not doing this right?"
5571,False,"Why won't anyone look at <hex:021A020203>me<hex:021A020103>!?"
5572,False,"How do you even lift that thing?"
5573,False,"Not easily, I'll tell you that..."
5574,False,"Let me guess...is it pineapple!?"
5575,False,"The chef told me the secret ingredient in the stew..."
5576,False,"This shall be the scene for my next masterpiece!"
5577,False,"Restoring such a mighty structure will be no small task...!"
5578,False,"The smashing's over! It's repairing time!"
5579,False,"The damage here is even worse than I thought..."
5580,False,"What do I get to smash next!?"
5581,False,"Can this truly be restored to its former glory?"
5582,False,"You're an inspiration to us all, Chief..."
5583,False,"Getting the stairwells just right is tricky, I hear..."
5584,False,"There's nothing my muscles can't overcome!"
5585,False,"Ngggaaaaaahhh!"
5586,False,"Yaaaaaahhh!"
5587,False,"It's all in the hips, they say!"
5588,False,"Next up is..."
5589,False,"Aye, this should serve nicely!"
5590,False,"Everything appears in good order..."
5591,False,"Isn't it impressive?"
5592,False,"Look at the size of this one!"
5593,False,"That should do."
5594,False,"Take care not to fall!"
5595,False,"You're quite dedicated, aren't you?"
5596,False,"A masterpiece shall be wrought..."
5597,False,"This is almost fun!"
5598,False,"I must do Ishgard proud with my stonework..."
5599,False,"Whatever you say, Chief!"
5600,False,"All stocked up!"
5601,False,"Hm? Did I miscount?"
5602,False,"Just like clockwork!"
5603,False,"Now where did I leave my hammer?"
5604,False,"A solid base if I ever saw one."
5605,False,"Looking good, I'd say."
5606,False,"How goes it?"
5607,False,"This is the final push!"
5608,False,"Do you know a good chirurgeon? My back is killing me..."
5609,False,"That's why I told you to lift with your legs..."
5610,False,"Looking better and better!"
5611,False,"And that should do it!"
5612,False,"Isn't she a beauty?"
5613,False,"Ooh! I want to fly in that!"
5614,False,"Is it done yet?"
5615,False,"I'd say you've earned yourselves a break."
5616,False,"Rest up well, for there's still work to be done!"
5617,False,"With a bit more muscle, maybe I'd be better at this..."
5618,False,"Your biceps! They cry out in pain!"
5619,False,"This wall appears to have escaped the war unscathed..."
5620,False,"I'll place an order. How many?"
5621,False,"We'll be needing more pickaxes."
5622,False,"Fine material, this!"
5623,False,"I must take inventory and report back quickly..."
5624,False,"...Ahhhhhh! Working so hard, sometimes I forget to breathe!"
5625,False,"A sight to stir the heart and inspire me to the heights of creative genius!"
5626,False,"This one's sure to be his magnum opus!"
5627,False,"Why, it's lovely!"
5628,False,"Best rest up now before the test flight."
5629,False,"Yes, I could use a cup of piping hot tea."
5630,False,"They're gone! Now's our chance!"
5631,False,"Kweh! Kweh!♪"
5632,False,"Kweh..."
5633,False,"Would you sit down?"
5634,False,"How can I? I should be out there, cutting down imperials!"
5635,False,"It is vital we overcome their advantage in numbers."
5636,False,"An advantage that keeps growing. Xeven's men were hit especially hard."
5637,False,"The enemy could launch a surprise attack at any moment, so be prepared!"
5638,False,"You'd be better off heading back to the infirmary and having that leg looked at."
5639,False,"But I can still fight!"
5640,False,"Most flattering... Ahem! For the sultana, that is."
5641,False,"Would that I could stay longer, but duty beckons..."
5642,False,"I remember it as though it were yesterday."
5643,False,"I fear the time has come for us to depart."
5644,False,"Does Philestiaux have any new tasks that need doing?"
5645,False,"Perhaps there are supplies that need procuring."
5646,False,"No good work ever got done on an empty stomach!"
5647,False,"I'd like nothing more than to go on a grand adventure!"
5648,False,"I've decided to return to Limsa. My beloved may be lost forever, but at least there I have memories..."
5649,False,"Look, we can use this stepladder!"
5650,False,"Hey, wait for me!"
5651,False,"W-Watch out!"
5652,False,"Are you sure this will suffice?"
5653,False,"Be sure to keep the inventory up to date."
5654,False,"You really have a way with that chisel, don't you?"
5655,False,"Hey, I'm no slouch myself!"
5656,False,"Heh! You're too kind, miss..."
5657,False,"This should do, Chief!"
5658,False,"One stone on top of the next..."
5659,False,"Leave it to me, Chief!"
5660,False,"The stairwell must be finished with all speed!"
5661,False,"One step at a time─Featherfall won't be built in a day!"
5662,False,"Good as done, Chief!"
5663,False,"This wall seems no worse for the wear..."
5664,False,"Cut, lay, fit, and repeat..."
5665,False,"Building a curved arch of stone is no small task!"
5666,False,"Perfection is ever elusive, but I am rather pleased with how this place turned out."
5667,False,"I'll study well, Chief!"
5668,False,"This magnificent window frame deserves only the finest glass...!"
5669,False,"Ishgardian architecture is truly the pride of the realm!"
5670,False,"The inclination of the slope is just as the chief calculated!"
5671,False,"Preposterous! Or is it...?"
5672,False,"They say the savior of Ishgard <hex:020815E905FF08>herself<hex:FF08>himself<hex:03> labors among us!"
5673,False,"How is it staying in the Hoarfrost?"
5674,False,"Why, I've never lived in such comfort!"
5675,False,"Oh, I've forgotten something again!"
5676,False,"Shhh! I'm trying to hide here!"
5677,False,"Where haven't I looked...?"
5678,False,"The captain runs a tight ship, to say the least..."
5679,False,"The freshest catches of the day, and exotic spices to season them! We have all you need!"
5680,False,"What shall we order from Maisenta?"
5681,False,"Mayhap some nuts and other fruits of the forest?"
5682,False,"By the Twelve, it's cold here! I can scarce feel my fingertips!"
5683,False,"Do any of our fine products catch your discerning eye?"
5684,False,"Good work, men!"
5685,False,"Get some rest! The next stage will be a demanding one."
5686,False,"Here's to a job well done!"
5687,False,"I could swear my biceps are bigger..."
5688,False,"My muscles haven't failed me yet!"
5689,False,"I knew I could count on you!"
5690,False,"Phew! That was the toughest job yet..."
5691,False,"My masterpiece is complete!"
5692,False,"Hey! What are you doing in there!?"
5693,False,"Get down at once─it's dangerous up there!"
5694,False,"Manacutter, full speed ahead! Whee!"
5695,False,"The adults are back! Let's get out of here!"
5696,False,"I'm sorry, mister!"
5697,False,"Practice the motion until it becomes second nature!"
5698,False,"Don't ask me! I don't know!"
5699,False,"You're always alone. Is something the matter?"
5700,False,"I lost my husband in the war..."
5701,False,"If there's anything I can do for you, just say the word!"
5702,False,"You're too kind..."
5703,False,"What in the─!? Noooooo!"
5704,False,"So this is the new branch of the manufactory..."
5705,False,"I can't wait to get to work!"
5706,False,"He's truly outdone himself this time."
5707,False,"Ishgard's not so bad...once you get used to the cold."
5708,False,"At least we won't lack for company."
5709,False,"Leave the cooking to me!"
5710,False,"And the manufactory's just a hop, skip, and jump away!"
5711,False,"It's the savior of Ishgard! In the flesh! Can I shake your hand?"
5712,False,"This is sure to win her heart!"
5713,False,"This should do it!"
5714,False,"The auger's store of aether is running low..."
5715,False,"The beaches are safe, for now... Let's hope that shark stays in the water where it belongs."
5716,False,"If any mean old sharks come ashore, Khloe will scare them away! Don't worry, Zhloe!"
5717,False,"Oh, you're Zhloe's personal hero!"
5718,False,"Now, let's go play on the beach!"
5719,False,"The emissaries never give up..."
5720,False,"And neither will I!"
5721,False,"You know, I'd love to perform here."
5722,False,"I could sing for my friends and family..."
5723,False,"I'll talk to the seneschal.<hex:02100103>He wouldn't dare say no!"
5724,False,"It's always so colorful!"
5725,False,"Did you see the costumes?"
5726,False,"For the Songbirds?<hex:02100103>Yes! Lisette did a fine job!"
5727,False,"Tra la la la la.♪"
5728,False,"Do doo da doo.♪"
5729,False,"La di da dah.♪"
5730,False,"Look! It's the Songbirds!"
5731,False,"Gosh, they're gorgeous!"
5732,False,"Shall we watch for a while?"
5733,False,"I suppose we should go..."
5734,False,"That was so much fun!"
5735,False,"It certainly was!"
5736,False,"I feel so close to Ulala!"
5737,False,"Now that you mention it..."
5738,False,"They do seem alike, kupo!"
5739,False,"Ulala! Over here!"
5740,False,"Narumi! My queen!"
5741,False,"Masha, I love you!"
5742,False,"I adore your outfits!"
5743,False,"The Songbirds are life!"
5744,False,"I wish we could talk to Elyne again."
5745,False,"And Kupka, too!"
5746,False,"Just a little more rest, then I can see the Songbirds!"
5747,False,"It's all so pretty!"
5748,False,"I wanted to help decorate..."

5752,False,"Where... <pant> <pant> could she have gone?"
5753,False,"Which do you prefer, my dear?"
5754,False,"Oh, the one with the ribbon is just lovely!"

5756,False,"Don't show any fear─they can smell it!"
5757,False,"Quite a fight she put up..."
5758,False,"Blood! Blood! Blood!"
5759,False,"One of you should take responsibility!"
5760,False,"Hurry up and punish somebody already."
5761,False,"I'm so tired of this."
5762,False,"I can't relax until we hang <hex:021A020203>someone<hex:021A020103> out to dry."
5763,False,"I haven't done anything...that you can prove."
5764,False,"I haven't slept in a week!"
5765,False,"Or twenty! Haha... Please help me."
5766,False,"Should have all the parts you need here."
5767,False,"The workshop seems so...peaceful."
5768,False,"Busy time?"
5769,False,"Seems like you could use a hand."
5770,False,"Perfect. I'll have a look."
5771,False,"Take a break! Relax!"
5772,False,"I can't believe we're working with Neillemard!"
5773,False,"More importantly, Nimie. Her eyes are so piercing... <sigh>"
5774,False,"True, but Denys is the gorgeous one..."
5775,False,"Wait, how long have we been out here?"
5776,False,"I could not have asked for a better present than spending the Starlight season with you!"
5777,False,"It's a miracle I was granted a respite from my duties."
5778,False,"Is it just me, or do things look particularly festive this year?"
5779,False,"We couldn't have done it without you."
5780,False,"See those decorations? They were all mine!"
5781,False,"They're beautiful! You truly have an eye for these things..."
5782,False,"We've got some new faces joining us today!"
5783,False,"Great! We could use the help!"
5784,False,"Rookies to boss around? All right!"
5785,False,"I'm with you, Chief!"
5786,False,"I'll put some muscle on you!"
5787,False,"Pray disregard my station. I will perform any task, and gladly."
5788,False,"Hyah!"
5789,False,"Can't help but feel I'm a bit rusty after all that time off..."
5790,False,"This thing is heavier than it looks..."
5791,False,"Ho!"
5792,False,"This city has so many more faces I must capture on canvas..."
5793,False,"Right back in the swing of things─just as I like to see it."
5794,False,"Have you ever lifted a pickaxe in your life?"
5795,False,"Good to be back on the job, Chief!"
5796,False,"I fear this is my first foray into manual labor..."
5797,False,"Let an expert show you how it's done!"
5798,False,"I thank you for your wisdom, my friend."
5799,False,"You have potential, I'll say that much."
5800,False,"Have to provide a good example for the newcomers!"
5801,False,"Yes, it's coming back to me now! It's all in the hips..."
5802,False,"Eyaaahhh!"
5803,False,"It's as hard as a... Well, I guess it is a rock."
5804,False,"All right! Which one of you dumped this rubbish here!?"
5805,False,"Now, now... Let's take a deep breath..."
5806,False,"How am I supposed to read these chocobo scratches!?"
5807,False,"Are you not, perchance, holding that backwards?"
5808,False,"Sixteen? Are you sure it wasn't eighteen?"
5809,False,"When in doubt, it never hurts to consult the skybuilders' board."
5810,False,"This is a vital task! Our inventory's not going to count itself."
5811,False,"Hey you! Up there! Don't forget to show the rookies how it's done!"
5812,False,"Keeping inventory may not be a glamorous task, but it's a necessary one."
5813,False,"Leave it to me, Chief!"
5814,False,"Consider it done, milo─er, Lord Chief."
5815,False,"We've got materials in spades, but we could use a few more hands."
5816,False,"Just leave it to me."
5817,False,"Let's see what else needs doing..."
5818,False,"I'll prepare it at once!"
5819,False,"I'd best place a new order before we run out of supplies..."
5820,False,"Report to me as soon as your task is done, you hear?"
5821,False,"Got it, Miss!"
5822,False,"How many times must I tell you to keep your eye on the nail!?"
5823,False,"Must keep focus... Must keep focus..."
5824,False,"Allow me to show you how it's─owww!"
5825,False,"Oh, dear... That couldn't have felt good..."
5826,False,"A tappity-tap here, a tappity-tap there..."
5827,False,"Am I doing this right?"
5828,False,"Looking good! Keep it up!"
5829,False,"I don't want to see a single bent nail! Understood?"
5830,False,"How's this, Chief?"
5831,False,"Looking rather sharp, if I do say so myself! Haha!"
5832,False,"Consider it done, Lord─er, Chief."
5833,False,"The masses may not appreciate it, but this will be my greatest masterpiece yet!"
5834,False,"Numbers aren't your strong suit, are they?"
5835,False,"Better safe than sorry..."
5836,False,"Seventy-one, seventy-two, seventy-four... Wait, where was I again?"
5837,False,"Pray forgive my impropriety, but mayhap you forgot seventy-three...?"
5838,False,"Sounds good to me!"
5839,False,"We have enough supplies here, yes?"
5840,False,"Shall I bring more from our reserves?"
5841,False,"Always good to see my skybuilders get into their work!"
5842,False,"Don't forget to rest up from time to time. We've a long way to go."
5843,False,"I learned it all from you, Chief!"
5844,False,"Now <hex:021A020203>that's<hex:021A020103> a generous donation! We'll put it to good use!"
5845,False,"You are far too kind, Chief..."
5846,False,"I said, watch out!"
5847,False,"Have to set a good example for the newcomers...!"
5848,False,"It's all in the─ow! Okay, now that was an example of what <hex:021A020203>not<hex:021A020103> to do."
5849,False,"Shall I summon a healer?"
5850,False,"At this rate, I'm going to run out of nails..."
5851,False,"One task done, now it's on to the next..."
5852,False,"Your technique's improved, I see."
5853,False,"I reckon you're a natural at this."
5854,False,"Tap, tap, tappity-tap!"
5855,False,"This may very well be my best work yet!"
5856,False,"You flatter me overmuch, Chief..."
5857,False,"Don't look down. Don't look down. Don't look─damn it all!"
5858,False,"Just like that, now. Take it nice and easy."
5859,False,"Truth be told, I enjoy working in silence."
5860,False,"You'll want to climb up to make sure everything is in place."
5861,False,"I can see I still have much to learn from my seniors..."
5862,False,"Now you're talking. I'm famished!"
5863,False,"Shall we take a short respite?"
5864,False,"Your stamina has improved greatly. Consider me impressed."
5865,False,"Always remember: endurance is as important as technique─if not more so."
5866,False,"Thanks, Chief! I've trained hard for this day!"
5867,False,"I'd best take another look at the plans..."
5868,False,"Endurance indeed. I thank you for your wisdom, Chief."
5869,False,"Be careful now, will you!?"
5870,False,"I've never seen wood of such quality!"
5871,False,"I've got it down this time, I swear. Just watch me n─owww!"
5872,False,"How did I know that was going to happen...?"
5873,False,"Bam! Bam! Bam!"
5874,False,"I wouldn't mind living in a house like this myself!"
5875,False,"Keep it up, and you'll need my supervision no longer."
5876,False,"Don't get ahead of yourself, now. One nail at a time."
5877,False,"Heh! I could never have done it without you, Chief!"
5878,False,"Could it be? Are we ahead of schedule?"
5879,False,"I will endeavor to do just that, milo─er, Chief."
5880,False,"Develop an eye for quality materials, and it will serve you well."
5881,False,"Just need to smooth and polish, now..."
5882,False,"I've developed quite the discerning eye, if I do say so myself..."
5883,False,"Do we have all we need?"
5884,False,"'Tis an honor to serve, Chief."
5885,False,"You've quite an aptitude for art, I'd say."
5886,False,"I reckon I'm even more talented with a chisel than with a hammer!"
5887,False,"I mean not to boast, but I have trained some in artistic pursuits."
5888,False,"Consider it done!"
5889,False,"Here it is! You know where it all goes. Thank you kindly!"
5890,False,"Well? What do you think?"
5891,False,"Remember: the final inspection's nigh as important as the job itself."
5892,False,"This won't hold in its current state. Better to reinforce it further."
5893,False,"Not a crack or blemish to speak of!"
5894,False,"That should do it! Now, to take one final look..."
5895,False,"As you command, Chief."
5896,False,"You require a demonstration, you say? Very well, then..."
5897,False,"The key is to put your whole body into it. Now behold! Hyaaaaaaaaah!"
5898,False,"You'll get the hang of it in no time."
5899,False,"What in the hells is this made of? My axe's scarcely even scratching it!"
5900,False,"If only the chief would give me a private lesson, too..."
5901,False,"Such power!"
5902,False,"The student has become a teacher. What a marvelous sight!"
5903,False,"This task is mine─and mine alone!"
5904,False,"It's all in the hips, you see?"
5905,False,"'Tis not nearly so simple as it looks. Your wisdom is invaluable."
5906,False,"How did it go again? The chief makes it look so easy..."
5907,False,"For the Firmament! For the chief! For our future!"
5908,False,"You've come a long way, haven't you?"
5909,False,"She'll notice me sooner or later─I just know it!"
5910,False,"That's the way!"
5911,False,"He-YAH!"
5912,False,"Is my work satisfactory?"
5913,False,"Mark my words: you will break before me. Hah!"
5914,False,"Ngggh... Yah!"
5915,False,"To think the reconstruction effort is almost at an end... Such a bittersweet feeling, it is."
5916,False,"Well, look who's showing the rookies the ropes now!"
5917,False,"I still remember the day he first joined up. He's like a whole new man!"
5918,False,"Worry not─I'll show you how it's done!"
5919,False,"You are truly a generous teacher, my friend."
5920,False,"Don't overdo it. Injure yourself, and you'll be no use to anyone."
5921,False,"You've got a knack for numbers. We've sorely needed someone like you."
5922,False,"This is quality stone, Chief! I can vouch for it!"
5923,False,"I can't shake the feeling that we're running low..."
5924,False,"I've done the calculations, and I do believe we have sufficient quantities of everything."
5925,False,"I just finished my count─I guarantee you I overlooked nothing!"
5926,False,"Thanks to you, I've neither a dearth nor a surplus of supplies!"
5927,False,"That's the last task on my list. I'd best check back at the skybuilders' board."
5928,False,"Aha...duly noted."
5929,False,"Everything seems to be in good order here."
5930,False,"Yes, <hex:021A020203>this<hex:021A020103>! <hex:021A020203>This<hex:021A020103> shall be my magnum opus!"
5931,False,"Oho! I can scarcely wait to see the finished work!"
5932,False,"Is there no limit to this man's talent and passion!?"
5933,False,"Why, it is as if the city comes to life on his canvas!"
5934,False,"Are my eyes to be believed?"
5935,False,"Practice makes perfect, after all!"
5936,False,"My fingers don't sting for once! Amazing!"
5937,False,"Pray teach me to wield the hammer with such skill."
5938,False,"Excellent. Make sure to teach the others."
5939,False,"Looking good. Carry on, carry on..."
5940,False,"Precision and speed. Both are essential..."
5941,False,"Where'd the chief go...?"
5942,False,"Might I trouble you to inspect my work, Chief?"
5943,False,"Hyah! Hyah!"
5944,False,"But of course! I'll be finished here any moment..."
5945,False,"We have another task for you..."
5946,False,"Look at how he's grown..."
5947,False,"Generous souls went out of their way to gather these materials for us. We must make the most of them."
5948,False,"Remember, quantity means nothing without quality!"
5949,False,"I am indebted to you for your wisdom."
5950,False,"I can scarce feel my hands!"
5951,False,"Have we finished, then...?"
5952,False,"She's twitching... Is that normal?"
5953,False,"Nothing quite like a kiln-fresh familiar."
5954,False,"I never knew familiar-creation could be so rough..."
5955,False,"Do you reckon these are dry yet?"
5956,False,"Welcome to the Firmament, my dear madam! What brings you to these heavenly environs today?"
5957,False,"I make for the Abacus. They say some most exquisite silks from the Far East have arrived!"
5958,False,"How splendid! Might I have the honor of escorting you there?"
5959,False,"You are far too kind, my good ser. 'Twould be a pleasure."
5960,False,"Fine furs and hides to shelter your skin from the bitter cold!"
5961,False,"Have anythin' what needs fixin'? I'm your man!"
5962,False,"I've never seen anything quite like it..."
5963,False,"Say no more, my good man! I have everything you need..."
5964,False,"Do you perchance have needles and thread in supply? I mean to learn weaving..."
5965,False,"Mayhap I, too, will write my memoirs one day..."
5966,False,"Ow! I want to find whoever dropped that kupo nut on the street and slap them silly!"
5967,False,"To soak a bit longer or head for the steam baths? <hex:021A020203>That<hex:021A020103> is the question..."
5968,False,"What a breathtaking sight...!"
5969,False,""
5970,False,"A studio befitting my prodigious talents!"
5971,False,"My masterpieces will surely fetch good coin in Featherfall..."
5972,False,"I will stop at nothing to see the Firmament safe for residents and visitors alike!"
5973,False,"All right, time to make the rounds again..."
5974,False,"This is our new home! Isn't it lovely?"
5975,False,"How warm and toasty it must be inside!"
5976,False,"How long does she mean to keep me waiting...?"
5977,False,"I bought some fine wine from a distant land. What say we raise a toast?"
5978,False,"Beg pardon, but what are you doing in front of our house?"
5979,False,"Finally, my dear sister and I have a home of our own!"
5980,False,"Let's go inside. We'll catch our death of cold out here."
5981,False,"The child will meet us here, they say?"
5982,False,"So I was told. Let us give her the warmest of welcomes."
5983,False,"W-Welcome, child─er, my daughter."
5984,False,"Forgive your father, my dear. He can be terribly stiff on these occasions."
5985,False,"Father! Mother! How happy I am to be part of your family!"
5986,False,"Well, doesn't your coat look so warm and toasty!"
5987,False,"Baaaaaa! Baaaaaa!"
5988,False,"And what a fine nest this is!"
5989,False,"Thanks to Ehll Tou, we're now allowed to live here, too!"
5990,False,"My back aches just looking at her..."
5991,False,"It's all in the hips!"
5992,False,"Well, look who's come to visit!"
5993,False,"Might I join you, kupo?"
5994,False,"'Tis my duty to see that all the instruments are tuned to perfection."
5995,False,"What a magnificent structure! Whatever do you suppose it's for?"
5996,False,"They say it's to serve as lodgings for luminaries and guests of honor."
5997,False,"No entry allowed. The interior is still undergoing renovations."
5998,False,"But that's all the coin I have..."
5999,False,"The other vendors may not be open for business yet, but we certainly are!"
6000,False,"How far this place has come..."
6001,False,"So these are our new barracks, eh?"
6002,False,"We'll need to ensure they're properly outfitted..."
6003,False,"Just look at this place! When are we moving in?"
6004,False,"Grow strong, my seedlings..."
6005,False,"Headed to the Pillars? They're just beyond here."
6006,False,"Ahhh! Who needs a waterfall when we have this right here in town?"
6007,False,"When will they let us in to play?"

7575,False,"How about we head to one of the other levels?"
7576,False,"Ooh, good idea! We can check out the nature restoration sector!"
7577,False,"Let's quickly review your contract..."
7578,False,"Good, good. It all seems quite reasonable to me."
7579,False,"Who's next, please?"
7580,False,"How can I help you today?"
7581,False,"Ah, that's me."
7582,False,"Ah, you'll need to head to the floor below for that procedure."
7583,False,"Um, okay. Can I get temporary elevator access?"
7584,False,"Hmm. Where do I go for advice about work?"
7585,False,"I could've sworn this was where they handled relocations..."
7586,False,"Guess I'll check with someone at the counter."
7587,False,"Where's she gotten to?"
7588,False,"Sorry! I got caught up with something..."
7589,False,"But if we moved here, we'd see each other all the time..."
7590,False,"I know, I know. The 'keep just isn't for me, though."
7591,False,"Hmm? What seems to be the problem?"
7592,False,""
7593,False,"How long is this gonna take?"
7594,False,"Zzz..."
7595,False,"I better not be getting reassigned again..."
7596,False,"What kind of work can I picture myself doing? Err..."
7597,False,"How's everything been lately?"
7598,False,"Honestly, people are still struggling to get over what happened."
7599,False,"Kunuk's so pretty..."
7600,False,"Time to check on our supplies..."
7601,False,"Fruits and vegetables aplenty... But we must eat them before they wasterot."
7602,False,"Roots, grain, spices... We have enough to feed many hungrytums."
7603,False,"Watching the world go by, coffee in hand─what could be better?"
7604,False,"Gotta make the most of my day off!"
7605,False,"Just leave me be...<hex:02100103>I got absolutely fleeced today..."

7610,False,"Wh-What!?"
7611,False,"Just one more cup!"
7612,False,"Slip the needle through here, and then..."
7613,False,"You're doing great, girl!<hex:02100103>Just a bit longer and you can rest!"
7614,False,"Mrrrmm!"
7615,False,"Mrm.♪"

7623,False,"Fluffy as a cloud!"
7624,False,"You've had enough."
7625,False,"Ahhh, that's the stuff!"
7626,False,"Nothing quite as relaxing as a cup of coffee."
7627,False,"It certainly has a lovely aroma..."
7628,False,"I daresay mezcal may<hex:02100103>sell well as an export..."
7629,False,"Not if we drink it all first."
7630,False,"So what do you say?<hex:02100103>It's a good deal, isn't it?"
7631,False,"Lower it a few pel<hex:02100103>and we can talk."
7632,False,"Mrm?"
7633,False,"Hrrrm.♪"
7634,False,"Mrm hrm.♪"
7635,False,"Put these over there..."
7636,False,"These could use<hex:02100103>more time to dry."
7637,False,"Oh yes, it's quite nice."
7638,False,"It has a robust flavor,<hex:02100103>doesn't it?"
7639,False,"May as well relax until it's<hex:02100103>time for the next shipment."
7640,False,"Need to pluck carefully, now..."
7641,False,"My, this one bore many fruit!"
7642,False,"We've quite the harvest here!"
7643,False,"Sated?"
7644,False,"I am. I still have tea, besides."
7645,False,"This one's also growing healthily."
7646,False,"Good, I don't see any pests."
7647,False,"A lovely idea. I'll see<hex:02100103>to the arrangements."
7648,False,"Get your local<hex:02100103>specialties here!"
7649,False,"My, everything looks<hex:02100103>like a qualitymake!"
7650,False,"What would you say to a gathering of our fellow merchants?"
7651,False,"I refuse! I've lowered<hex:02100103>the price enough!"
7652,False,"Yeah, it's damned smooth..."
7653,False,"Quality liquor, isn't it?"
7654,False,"The Pelupelu are keen to purchase that item..."
7655,False,"How much are they<hex:02100103>willing to pay?"
7656,False,"Lower! Too expensive!"
7657,False,"Ahhh..."
7658,False,"I can feel the aches of my travels just melting away..."
7659,False,"Skin feels all moist and slick─even under mobbiemask!"
7660,False,"Nothing beats a drink after a hot bath!"
7661,False,"You're only going to order mezcal?"
7662,False,"Indeed. I'm rather<hex:02100103>fond of the stuff."
7663,False,"You're drinking mezcal?"
7664,False,"There's no better time than<hex:02100103>after a hard day's work."
7665,False,"I'm impressed you can drink.<hex:02100103>I'm utterly exhausted."
7666,False,"How fare the murals?"
7667,False,"For a blessing, well."
7668,False,"Whew..."
7669,False,"What a beauty..."
7670,False,"How fares your new Everkeep assignment?"
7671,False,"Wait─we're one short? I'll check the storehouse..."
7672,False,"Everything looks to be accounted for..."
7673,False,"Could I interest anyone in a light meal?"
7674,False,"That would be wonderful, thank you!"
7675,False,"Let me just finish telling this story first."
7676,False,"Of course, sweetheart. I'll see you inside."
7677,False,"Any problems with the machinery?"
7678,False,"Everything looks to be stable, sir!"
7679,False,"It had better be, or this town will fall apart."
7680,False,"This place will be good for me, I can feel it."
7681,False,"What'll you make next?"
7682,False,"I haven't decided yet."
7683,False,"My, that's not like you. If you need any ideas, I'm full of them!"
7684,False,"Let's see... Should I put this here?"
7685,False,"Hey, is this the right box?"
7686,False,"It's the wrong one─check the label!"
7687,False,"Huh? Are you sure?"
7688,False,"There's a list in the storeroom. I suggest you read it closely."
7689,False,"A great catch requires great patience."
7690,False,"This seems like a good spot to cast."
7691,False,"Maybe today I'll catch a fish larger than myself..."
7692,False,"Hmm... It might be time to move."
7693,False,"I can see the fish under the water!"
7694,False,"Whoooaaa!"
7695,False,"No bites here either..."
7696,False,"The fish I caught here last time fed me for a week!"
7697,False,"No bites... What am I doing wrong?"
7698,False,"I'll take a break, then try again..."
7699,False,"How goes the fishing?"
7700,False,"<snore> Zzz..."
7701,False,"Not well, it seems."
7702,False,"Any bites today?"
7703,False,"Too many to count!"
7704,False,"Well done!"
7705,False,"I think I can catch a few more..."
7706,False,"Good luck! I should go check on the dried fish."
7707,False,"It's time to collect the fish!"
7708,False,"The reeds are bursting with life once again!"
7709,False,"They're beautiful..."
7710,False,"The water is just right."
7711,False,"The depth looks perfect."
7712,False,"I think our reed problems are behind us."
7713,False,"They grow with such vigor!"
7714,False,"Where did I put them again?"
7715,False,"Here...?"
7716,False,"Not here either..."
7717,False,"Have you seen my tools?"
7718,False,"I thought they were yours. Hold on."
7719,False,"...Here. Don't lose them again."
7720,False,"I won't, I promise. Many thanks!"
7721,False,"You said he wanted to talk?"
7722,False,"Yes, but..."
7723,False,"I don't know if he's awake or asleep..."
7724,False,"I see... Well, I suppose I can come back later!"
7725,False,"He should be awake by now..."
7726,False,"I can barely keep my eyes open... Hmm... Time for a short nap."
7727,False,"It's time to get to work!"
7728,False,"All right, all right. I'll be there soon!"
7729,False,"Now, the best trap to catch fish is..."
7730,False,"Interesting, interesting. But shouldn't you get to work?"
7731,False,"Oh! It completely slipped my mind!"
7732,False,"He's going to pluck my feathers!"
7733,False,"I hope he makes it... Oh! I'd better get back to work, too!"
7734,False,"Dangerstraits! Have you seen my twinklestones?"
7735,False,"Again!? You always lose them!"
7736,False,"The old boxes were replaced with new ones. Your twinklestones might be in a yellow one."
7737,False,"Oh, thank you, thank you! I will look!"
7738,False,"Oh, happyfeels! I found my twinklestones!"
7739,False,"Don't misplace them again!"
7740,False,"You must keep carefulwatch over storage and supplies! Don't let them get mixed up."
7741,False,"I won't make any more mistakes!"
7742,False,"Wonderdeeds! Keep it up!"
7743,False,"It's all coming together!"
7744,False,"Ore disappears in an eyeblink! We need more!"
7745,False,"Golden glitterstones are all the rage, I've heard!"
7746,False,"One, two! One, two! Moblins can be burlystrong, too!"
7747,False,"That's right! We'll temper our bodies like a weapon!"
7748,False,"Something greenish with a bit of red would be nice."
7749,False,"Understood! Mobbie will craftymake you something astounding!"
7750,False,"What will I catch today?"
7751,False,"Gazing at the rivers usually sets my mind at ease, but during the storm they were a nightmare..."
7752,False,"I know what you mean. The flooding waters were a chilling sight."
7753,False,"Are these the goods you were talking about?"
7754,False,"No! The crate I'm looking for is much bigger!"
7755,False,"You're serious, aren't you? Well, I'll be back then..."
7756,False,"My son struggles to command the wind."
7757,False,"Where shall we strike our next deal, I wonder? What do you think?"
7758,False,"I'm going to tumblefall!"
7759,False,"It's not high! Just fall─you'll barely hurtyfeel it! Let go!"
7760,False,"Nooo! Neveeer!"
7761,False,"Perhaps it's time we replaced our hover cargo."
7762,False,"Now for today's shipment..."
7763,False,"How goes the safety assessment?"
7764,False,"Lightning levels seem normal. All clear."
7765,False,"Remind me, where do we send the ore shipments?"
7766,False,"First level. It has to pass inspection, remember?"
7767,False,"Bureaucracy at its finest."
7768,False,"Huh... I guess I had it right all along."
7769,False,"All items accounted for. Now to set the destination..."
7770,False,"One of my friends was just assigned the role of hunter!"
7771,False,"Gods, I wish it were me. <sigh> If only I'd passed the exam..."
7772,False,"Is this all the scrap we're bringing to Everkeep?"
7773,False,"Not quite. The reforgers told me they've found something in the ruins."
7774,False,"How are we doing, ladies? Hungry?"
7775,False,"Conversion rate looks normal."
7776,False,"That's it...<hex:02100103>Grow nice and tasty for me..."
7777,False,"At this stage, we'll need mesh to keep the bugs off."
7778,False,"Then I'd better put an order in!"
7779,False,"Note to self─buy tarps.<hex:02100103>Lots of tarps."
7780,False,"And bug repellent!<hex:02100103>We really don't want an oglop infestation."
7781,False,"No one's following..."
7782,False,"Is someone there?"
7783,False,"I'm in the clear... I need to hurry!"
7784,False,"I made it!"
7785,False,"D-Did something move?"
7786,False,"It's just my imagination..."
7787,False,"You're with <hex:021A020203>her<hex:021A020103>!?"
7788,False,"The map points here!"
7789,True,"Balloons! Grab your balloons to the Endless House here!"
7790,False,"We're short on just about everything because of this war..."
7791,False,"<sigh> Will there ever be peace again?"
7792,False,"Come on, let's go and see the princess!"
7793,False,"R-Right... Oh gods, I'm so nervous..."
7794,False,"From her memories, she will be reborn to lead us always."
7795,False,"Our eternal queen... This is a new dawn for the realm."
7796,False,"I can't make it... I can't take another step..."
7797,False,"Don't give up! We're almost to the castle!"
7798,False,"Ah, another beautiful day beneath Everkeep's barrier."
7799,False,"What does the future hold for us...?"
7800,False,"Did you hear the rumors about the queen?"
7801,False,"You mean that her memories were preserved?"
7802,False,"Decorations are pretty, ain't they?"
7803,False,"The whole city is. We should travel like this more often."
7804,False,"See!? I told you it'd be worth the journey!"
7805,False,"Yes, it was quite a display."
7806,False,"Still adventuring, are you?"
7807,False,"Of course! Why, just the other day..."
7808,False,"Sicard worked awfully hard this Rising."
7809,False,"Mayhap I should make him some small gift, in recognition of his efforts."
7810,False,"I'm sure he would like that very much, my lord."
7811,False,"Whither shall we venture next?"
7812,False,"I don't know. The bar?"
7813,False,"Did you see the fireworks?"
7814,False,"That I did! Nearly went overboard gawpin' at 'em!"
7815,False,"Reckon folks were smilin' more'n ever this year!"
7816,False,"A banana...?"
7817,False,"And what flavor would that be?"
7818,False,"Come with me for a moment."
7819,False,"I see..."
7820,False,"That smoke..."
7821,False,"Papa, look! Isn't it wonderful?"
7822,False,"Careful, lad. It's a long way down."
7823,False,"Hm... What would you like to do first?"
7824,False,"I can't decide... What would <hex:021A020203>you<hex:021A020103> like to do first?"
7825,False,"Why don't we have some ice cream?"
7826,False,"Fancy a box of our delicious cookies?"
7827,False,"One? I think I'd like three..."
7828,False,"Shall we challenge that quizzed tour again?"
7829,False,"Oh, yes! We'll have to try for a perfect score this time."
7830,False,"It's so pretty..."
7831,False,"...And he dove headfirst into the canal!"
7832,False,"Gods, I wish I could have seen it."
7833,False,"I'm so glad we can be together again..."
7834,False,"I highly recommend our Mica the Mu figurines."
7835,False,"It's been ages since we last met like this."
7836,False,"Well, we've all been rather busy..."
7837,False,"But now it's just like old times!"
7838,False,"Such splendid scenery."
7839,False,"I could gaze upon it for the rest of my days..."
7840,False,"You've not been to the Daguerreo Medical Collection?"
7841,False,"Not yet... I suppose I should pay it a visit!"
7842,False,"The water's nice and cool!"
7843,False,"I remember the day we first met..."
7844,False,"Are we allowed to swim here, I wonder...?"
7845,False,"We've plenty of sweet treats to satisfy your appetite!"
7846,False,"I-I thought you'd left me all alone..."
7847,False,"I'm so sorry, dear... You'll never be alone again."
7848,False,"That's right. We'll always be together, the three of us."
7849,False,"...And then, I tumbled right down the hill!"
7850,False,"Perhaps we could buy matching accessories..."
7851,False,"Please form a single-file line as you enter!"
7852,False,"I can't wait for the ride!"
7853,False,"This place hardly feels real..."
7854,False,"And yet it is!"
7855,False,"Mother, may I have an ice cream?"
7856,False,"Well, Father?"
7857,False,"Ask your father, love. I'm brainstorming at the moment..."
7858,False,"I'm on the cusp of a breakthrough. Why not ask your mother?"
7859,False,"I'm told the animals are quite friendly."
7860,False,"You'd best jump down before you fall."
7861,False,"I'll be fine, I promise!"
7862,False,"They've a host of rare specimens here."
7863,False,"The battles here are exhilarating!"
7864,False,"I want to stay like this forever..."
7865,False,"I wouldn't trade these quiet moments for anything."
7866,False,"Huh? Wh-Where did she go?"
7867,False,"Oh, dear... Where's he run off to now?"
7868,False,"Keep going!"
7869,False,"Perfect!"
7870,False,"Try jumping to a thousand!"
7871,False,"I-I'm feeling queasy just looking at it..."
7872,False,"So that's how the castle looked..."
7873,False,"They say this place once kept all sorts of species."
7874,False,"She's been in there a while..."
7875,False,"Ahhh, it's much cooler out here!"
7876,False,"Apologies for the wait!"
7877,False,"I'm not done yet─just taking a break."
7878,False,"All right, back to the sauna for me!"
7879,False,"I could use a break soon..."
7880,False,"Strawberry or mint chocolate chip? That is the question..."
7881,False,"That last bout was incredible!"
7882,False,"I should've bought<hex:02100103>ice cream too..."
7883,False,"Why not hurry and buy some?"
7884,False,"What'd you think<hex:02100103>of that last bout?"
7885,False,"I think the referee<hex:02100103>was full of shite!"
7886,False,"Which match are you most keen to see?"
7887,False,"The third one, of course!"
7888,False,"This's the best spot for spectatin'."
7889,False,"I wish I could<hex:02100103>compete as well..."

7895,False,"Shapin' up to be a good harvest."
7896,False,"We might try sellin'<hex:02100103>bangles from the potsworn."
7897,False,"I should think they'll<hex:02100103>fetch a fair price."
7898,False,"...and then you<hex:02100103>fry it with nopales."
7899,False,"That sounds amazing!"
7900,False,"The bastard swindled me!"
7901,False,"Maybe the Dustwatch can help."
7902,False,"I ain't <hic> goin'<hex:02100103>back to no springs..."
7903,False,"Not without one<hex:02100103>more drink! <hic>"
7904,False,"One more... <snore>"

7907,False,"It's true! Heard it from the<hex:02100103>merchants in Tuliyollal!"
7908,False,"But the Pelupelu<hex:02100103>tell it different..."
7909,False,"Wife said it's the<hex:02100103>best she ever had."
7910,False,"Hah! Sure she did."
7911,False,"Maybe one more<hex:02100103>log wouldn't hurt."
7912,False,"Not a bug in sight. Thank goodness."
7913,False,"...And which one of you<hex:02100103>are we cooking tonight?"
7914,False,"We've had quite the<hex:02100103>harvest this season."
7915,False,"It was worth the time spent<hex:02100103>seeding the crops earlier."
7916,False,"I'm afraid we'll need more<hex:02100103>meat for the stew."
7917,False,"But I've just returned<hex:02100103>from hunting..."
7918,False,"Any tobacco to spare, friend?"
