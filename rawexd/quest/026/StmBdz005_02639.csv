Your assistance is greatly appreciated. The drones were not in our possession for very long, but a cursory inspection showed they are made with a heretofore unknown metal alloy."
53,"TEXT_STMBDZ005_02639_GNIBNPHA_000_011","They are all but impervious to traditional firearms, which is why we commissioned Garlond Ironworks to fashion a weapon capable of penetrating their armor."

55,"TEXT_STMBDZ005_02639_GNIBNPHA_000_013","If I am not mistaken, this would not be the first time you've piloted one of these suits. It should take you no time, then, to familiarize yourself with the controls."
56,"TEXT_STMBDZ005_02639_GNIBNPHA_000_014","Now, the drones were last sighted due east of here and to the north along the Velodyna River. I fear recapturing them is out of the question, so do whatever you deem necessary to stop them."
57,"TEXT_STMBDZ005_02639_GNIBNPHA_000_015","I doubt they've gone much further than the Velodyna River. Please hurry, before anyone comes to harm."
58,"TEXT_STMBDZ005_02639_LOEZKIRZ_000_020","Welcome back. I take it the drones have been disposed of, then. Excellent work."
59,"TEXT_STMBDZ005_02639_LOEZKIRZ_000_021","We were quite fortunate for your presence. Save for Lieutenant G'nibnpha, none of my men can even activate a suit of magitek armor, let alone pilot one in combat."
60,"TEXT_STMBDZ005_02639_LOEZKIRZ_000_022","I only pray that isn't to our detriment in the future. There's still plenty more of those drones out there along Baelsar's Wall. If any more of them should suddenly stir..."
61,"TEXT_STMBDZ005_02639_LOEZKIRZ_000_023","At any rate, we will continue working with Garlond Ironworks so that should such a day come, we will be ready."
