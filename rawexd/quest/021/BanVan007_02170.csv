After thanking you for everything you have done for the Gundu, she states that today's battle should be left to the Vanu Vanu to settle, and asks that you go to Ok' Zundu to tell Sonu Vanu that the group's preparations are complete."

Go to the northeast, where the Vundu have been sighted, and wait for the Vanu Vanu to arrive."

The Vundu seem unaffected, however, accepting the challenge with their own dance. Succumbing to the Vundu's ferocity, the Gundu and Zundu dancers lose the will to continue. Refusing to leave your allies to their fate, you descend from your position and show the Vundu your own sundrop dance. The Vundu are taken aback by your fury, and the Zundu and Gundu are inspired to match your steps. The renewed power of the sundrop dance strikes fear into the hearts of the Vundu, and they flee back to their village in defeat. With the Gundu and Zundu tribes victorious, they depart into the sunset to celebrate their newfound freedom."
