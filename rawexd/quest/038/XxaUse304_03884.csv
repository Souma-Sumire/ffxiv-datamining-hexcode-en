2,"TEXT_XXAUSE304_03884_SEQ_02","You find yourself drawn to a sobbing child, who tells you of a man who visited Stonesthrow and persuaded a number of people, including her parents, to leave with him. No sooner is your interest piqued than the man returns. You confront him, only to watch as he runs off like a coward in the direction of the Ul'dah Dispatch Yard.

The commotion draws the attention of two Stone Torches, one of whom would like to know why you are standing next to a dead man."

Satisfied with your statement, the Stone Torch bids you carry on with your work. Return to the Hall of Flames and report your findings to Commander Swift."
