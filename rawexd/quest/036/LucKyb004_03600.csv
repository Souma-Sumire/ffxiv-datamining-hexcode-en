49,"TEXT_LUCKYB004_03600_HALLDOR_000_002","But it's not enough, is it? Don't deny it. Nay, you need to experience it all: the terrifying lows, the dizzying highs, the creamy middles! And they need it too, if not more─why else would those Eulmoran bastards offer bigger and bigger bounties?"
50,"TEXT_LUCKYB004_03600_HALLDOR_000_003","They're waiting for you to slip up, just once. To give them a spectacular death. But you won't go quietly, oh no─you'll bleed them for every last gil and then some!"
51,"TEXT_LUCKYB004_03600_HALLDOR_000_004","And soon you'll have the chance to do so on an entirely different scale. How, you ask? By slaying elite marks, that's how!"
52,"TEXT_LUCKYB004_03600_HALLDOR_000_005","They're like nothing you've ever faced before. Wild and unpredictable, possessed of surpassing strength and guile. Many are the men who have left to slay such fiends, never to return."
53,"TEXT_LUCKYB004_03600_HALLDOR_000_006","But their failures will only serve to season the dish that is your victory! The greater the risk, the greater the reward─extrinsic and intrinsic, no? Which is why you must speak with Xylle without further delay!"

64,"TEXT_LUCKYB004_03600_XYLLE_000_059","I rather think you have only yourself to blame for that. After all, was it not you who encouraged him and the others to strike you down and claim leadership?"

How are we supposed to build a sustainable organization when you keep encouraging people to kill themselves in the most violent and pointless ways possible!?"
