As ever, the Boutique is willing to part with extraordinary components from Qeshi-Trao's collection, but no rarity comes without its price, and you are tasked once again with the procurement of quality trade goods.<hex:02100103><hex:02100103>※Please note that you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
