1,"TEXT_BANIXA305_01518_SEQ_01","Rozol Cattlan has asked you to synthesize for him a component for the <hex:021A020203>Dezul Qualan<hex:021A020103>'s aerodynamo─a delicate instrument which will help keep the airship aloft after takeoff. The Ehcatl Nine knotcounter has personally spoken with Templeton and does not believe you will need to bribe the Highwind Skyways representative to gain access to the crafting facilities at the Observatorium. The knotcounter also does not believe a thing Templeton says, so he warns you to be ready to perform some random task for the unappreciative sot.<hex:02100103><hex:02100103>※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
