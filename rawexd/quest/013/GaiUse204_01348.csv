Rather than petitioning another nation for aid, the Domans might instead travel to the outpost of Revenant's Toll, where they could work as frontier hands in exchange for food and shelter. Though Yugiri is amenable to the idea, the matter of how the refugees would make a journey of so great a distance remains.
