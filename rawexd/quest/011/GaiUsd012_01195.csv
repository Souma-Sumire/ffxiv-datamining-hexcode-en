5,"TEXT_GAIUSD012_01195_SEQ_05","Commander Heuloix surmises that the unsettling memento you retrieved from the Howling Eye is likely some manner of ritual object. Return to the Waking Sands in Vesper Bay, and consult with Urianger on the nature of your grisly trophy."
6,"TEXT_GAIUSD012_01195_SEQ_06","You deliver the ritual focus to Urianger, and the scholarly Elezen surmises that Garuda's enhanced powers are likely the result of an altered rite of summoning. Doubting the Ixal's willingness to meddle with the traditional ritual, Urianger suspects the involvement of the chaos-breeding Ascians. As if to underscore his suspicions, the Scion prepares to tell you of yet another primal threat..."
