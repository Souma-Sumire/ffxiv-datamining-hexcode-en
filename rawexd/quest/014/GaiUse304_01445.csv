Unsurprisingly, Landebert has no intention of listening to your side of the story, nor less of helping you. Yet in a curious twist of fate, your quarry chooses that exact moment to return to Pearl Lane, presumably hoping to recruit more refugees. As your eyes meet, the merchant grasps the situation and turns to flee. Do not let him escape!"
3,"TEXT_GAIUSE304_01445_SEQ_03","As one would expect, the merchant is quick to deny your accusations, and equally quick to confess when pressed. He offers to divulge all that he knows, only to fall at your feet a moment later, an arrow having pierced his chest. The commotion draws the attention of two Stone Torches, one of whom would like to know why you are standing next to a dead man."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSE304_01445_SEQ_04","You explain to the Stone Torch that the merchant was felled by an arrow from afar, and that he was the subject of your investigation into the refugee uprisings. Satisfied with your statement, the Stone Torch bids you carry on with your work. Return to the Hall of Flames and report your findings to Commander Swift."
