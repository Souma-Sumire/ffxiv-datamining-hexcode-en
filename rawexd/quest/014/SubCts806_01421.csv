1,"TEXT_SUBCTS806_01421_SEQ_01","You are a tad fuzzy on the details, but, with a wink and a nod, Wiscard has sent you off to deliver a leather bag to Rowena. You can only hope that his promises of newfound performance and fashion have merit."
2,"TEXT_SUBCTS806_01421_SEQ_02","You have conveyed the bag and Wiscard's well-wishes to Rowena, with explosive results. Try to think happy thoughts as you hasten back to the flamboyant trader."
3,"TEXT_SUBCTS806_01421_SEQ_03","Wiscard practically writhes in ecstasy at Rowena's loathing, proving that one truly does create one's own reality. He presents you with a glamour prism, which has the power to make one object look like another. Now you, too, can look the part of a successful adventurer!"

49,"TEXT_SUBCTS806_01421_WISCARD_000_001","Now, allow me to segue into the first person so we can get down to business. And that business is...you! And <hex:021A020203>you<hex:021A020103>, <hex:020814E905FF07>sister<hex:FF08>brother<hex:03> adventurer, are not looking so good."
50,"TEXT_SUBCTS806_01421_WISCARD_000_002","In fact, it hurts the entire adventurer brand to have you walking about looking the way you do. Oh, your equipment may be of good quality, but people expect flash! Romance! Sure, you might provide results, but check the trends, <hex:02080FE905FF06>woman<hex:FF04>man<hex:03>─that doesn't sell!"
51,"TEXT_SUBCTS806_01421_WISCARD_000_003","Now, I can help you. In fact, I'm probably the only person who can. For just a small service rendered, I can show you how to perform better, and─even more importantly─<hex:021A020203>look<hex:021A020103> better!"

53,"TEXT_SUBCTS806_01421_WISCARD_000_009","What's that? You find your conversation skills lacking? Hah, nonsense! I could tell immediately you're special. Let me guess: felt like the odd one out as a youngling, right? When you get back, you're going to tell me all about it!"
54,"TEXT_SUBCTS806_01421_ROWENA_000_010","Hm? Somethin' from ol' Wiscard? And he <hex:021A020203>winked<hex:021A020103> at you, too? Gods, this should be rich. Well, let's have it, then."
