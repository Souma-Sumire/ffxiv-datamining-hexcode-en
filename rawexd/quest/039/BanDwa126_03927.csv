53,"TEXT_BANDWA126_03927_SHIGITT_000_030","What I need from you is a replacement casing for protecting the automaton's main joints. We can't have it rolling through the dirt and the mud with all its...uh...“bits” exposed."
54,"TEXT_BANDWA126_03927_SHIGITT_000_040","What I need from you is a fresh batch of oil for the automaton's reserves. It's running low after leaking from several, um, “unplanned” perforations, and the supply's been contaminated with debris in any case..."
