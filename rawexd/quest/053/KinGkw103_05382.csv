Thankfully, it appears the survey team have managed to extract a sizable quantity of waxing arcanite, which will be necessary to refine your phantom weapon. Given ongoing contractual obligations to the House of Splendors, however, you will need to purchase the requisite three chunks of ore from Ermina, their mercantile representative on the isle.
